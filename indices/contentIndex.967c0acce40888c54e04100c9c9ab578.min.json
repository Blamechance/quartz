this means I passively generate content, and perhaps through integration, writing online could also feel as frictionless. \n- Both apps are written in native markdown content, making translation to web pages easy. \n- The value of each resource is substantial, but integrated, the resulting personal ecosystem could be way greater. \n\nI decided instead to stand on the shoulders of [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) 's incredible Quartz repo as the touchstone, and adapt my solution from there. \n\nIn the event it's useful for others, here are the steps I took to get it all going. \nIt involves: \n- [The Quartz Repository, by Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n- An existing [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/)\n\t- A particularly useful related plugin is [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint), for generating MOC pages. \n- [GitHub Pages for hosting](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n- And a little scripting for quality of life changes. \n---\n\n## Linux (ubuntu) installation:\n\nFirstly, fork and clone the following repo locally:\n\n````\nhttps://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n````\n\n### 1. Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n````\nsudo snap install hugo\n````\n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n   \n   * Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n   * [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n\n````\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n````\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n\ta. Confirm where GO installed itself (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\t\n\tb. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\t\n\tc. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\n   a. Get the modules required:\n   \n   ````\n   go get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   b. Install from repo:\n   \n   ````\n   go get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   c. Test with:\n   \n   ````\n   hugo-obsidian version\n   ````\n\n3. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n   \n   ````\n   make serve\n   ````\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n   \n   * I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n   * My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n   * All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n#### Automating export:\nHere's a quick and dirty bash script to clears the repo's copy of the vault and index files, to copy in the current ones from the obsidian vault location. \n\nAutomating this process means the creation process of posts is simple:\n1. Write/edit posts and index file as notes in obsidian\n2. Run `make serve` to host local render of website. \n3. Run script in terminal to update the browser render live. \n4. To post, push on git! \n\nFeel free to adapt if the idea is useful.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nSOURCE_PATH=~/path/to/source\nDESTINATION_PATH=~/path/to/destination\n\n# Delete all files in the target export folder - public_digital_garden is the folder that i've placed all my obsidian notes in (both in my vault and the quartz folder). Adapt for your folder name. \n\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden/*\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/_index.md\n\n# Copy index file and public folder from obsidian vault to export folder for git pushing\ncp -r \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\ncp \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/_index.md \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\n```\n---\n#### References: \nResources:\n* https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\n* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart\n* [Publishing your Vault Online With Quartz](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) - [Brandon Boswell](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T22:43:25.892621947Z","tags":["obsidian","quartz"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Dreams-without-goals-are-just-dreams-and-ultimately-they-fuel-disappointment":{"title":"Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment.","content":"\n[YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LspuaSV_qII) \n\n\u003eDreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment.

It also makes the solution/concept more engaging when learned. \n\n- Can also look at problems, and try and reverse-engineer the applied concept — this has the same effect.\n- Focus on learning concepts as a big picture of the solution — abstraction is key, as details can be figured out later.\n\n\t![focusingunconsciousmind1](Digital-Cottage/Resonance%20Journal/images/unconsciousmind1.png)\n\t- This includes making insights and mental associations to existing ideas — research further if required to facilitate this.\n\n### The process:\n\n![unconsciousmind2](Digital-Cottage/Resonance%20Journal/images/unconsciousmind2.png)\n\n1. Start with how it slots in the big picture. \n2. Pick a detail to learn, and understand it both by itself, and within the big picture context. \n    - Part of slotting the new concept into the “big picture” is enabling insights and associations with existing ideas that make sense.\n3. In both instances, invest genuine interest and interaction while also trying to invest parts of the solution as you go. \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T22:43:25.892621947Z","tags":["resonance-journal","youtube","learning"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Resonance-Journal":{"title":"Resonance Journal","content":"### A free-for-all list of all the content I consume that resonates with me. \n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment|Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)|Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)]]\n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-27T22:43:25.892621947Z","tags":["MOC"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Personally-Defined-Rules-For-Learning-With-AI":{"title":"Personally Defined Rules For Learning With AI","content":"[[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Thoughts And Mental Snippets|Thoughts And Mental Snippets]]\nFundamentally, AI should be used as a first-point substitution for scanning of documentation, rubber ducky-ing as well as a tool to reduce start-up friction to tasks  — but rarely as a tool for bridging gaps in logic ability.\n\n\u003e[!danger]\n\u003eAny new information provided by AI should be understood and learned before utilising — NEVER implement code or logic you do not understand. \n\n1. Primarily, use AI as a form of rubber duckying. This includes: \n    - Checking for correct syntax/syntax combinations.\n        - New syntax should always be understood, and tested with before implementing.\n    - Clarifying understanding of syntax, methods or other language features.\n        - ***********“is it correct to say…”***********\n    - Debugging issues, only after giving it at least a reasonable amount of time, in exhausting potential angles that can be theorised.\n\n2.
