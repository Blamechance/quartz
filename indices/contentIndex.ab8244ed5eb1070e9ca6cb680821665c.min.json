But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces. The person who cannot resist food or alcohol, or whose mind is constantly focused on sex, is not free to direct his or her psychic energy. ^ref-34014\n\nNote:\n\nThe value against natural impulses\n\n\n---\nPage: 29\n\nSubmission to genetic programming can become quite dangerous, because it leaves us helpless. A person who cannot override genetic instructions when necessary is always vulnerable. Instead of deciding how to act in terms of personal goals, he has to surrender to the things that his body has been programmed (or misprogrammed) to do. One must particularly achieve control over instinctual drives to achieve a healthy independence of society, for as long as we respond predictably to what feels good and what feels bad, it is easy for others to exploit our preferences for their own ends. ^ref-31231\n\nNote:\n\nBeing unable to act against what is comfortable and comes naturally, will lead to being at the whim of those forces, and not navigating to where one WANTS to go, but rather where their natural behaviour takes them.\nPersonal success however, is often built on doing what is uncomfortable, even if only at first.\n\n\n---\nPage: 27\n\nAs Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not. Socialization, or the transformation of a human organism into a person who functions successfully within a particular social system, cannot be avoided. The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments. And the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longer can imagine themselves breaking any of its rules. ^ref-45050\n\nNote:\n\nOn value of socialisation of populations\n\n\n---\nPage: 30\n\nThe solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one’s own powers. ^ref-23837\n\nNote:\n\nBe internally motivated, to avoid external disruption to goals and manipulation .\n\n\n---\nPage: 37\n\nself-delusions—lies that an overly receptive mind tells itself. ^ref-14258\n\n---\nPage: 38\n\nWith ^ref-27581\n\n---\nPage: 28\n\nIt is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. ^ref-4943\n\n---\nPage: 36\n\nOver the endless dark centuries of its evolution, the human nervous system has become so complex that it is now able to affect its own states, making it to a certain extent functionally independent of its genetic blueprint and of the objective environment. A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness. ^ref-24557\n\n---\nPage: 39\n\nWe may call intentions the force that keeps information in consciousness ordered. Intentions arise in consciousness whenever a person is aware of desiring something or wanting to accomplish something. Intentions are also bits of information, shaped either by biological needs or by internalized social goals. They act as magnetic fields, moving attention toward some objects and away from others, keeping our mind focused on some stimuli in preference to others. We often call the manifestation of intentionality by other names, such as instinct, need, drive, or desire. But these are all explanatory terms, telling us why people behave in certain ways. Intention is a more neutral and descriptive term; it doesn’t say why a person wants to do a certain thing, but simply states that he does. ^ref-23353\n\n---\nPage: 41\n\nIndividuals who depart from the norms—heroes, saints, sages, artists, and poets, as well as madmen and criminals—look for different things in life than most others do. The existence of people like these shows that consciousness can be ordered in terms of different goals and intentions. Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality. ^ref-58440\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Books/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People-Covey":{"title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Covey","content":"# Notes:\n\n---\n\n### Highlights\nPage: 10\n\nThe Character Ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character. But shortly after World War 1 the basic view of success shifted from the Character Ethic to what we might call the Personality Ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. ^ref-18991\n\nNote:\n\nCharacter ethic vs Personality ethic\n\n\n---\nPage: 14\n\nMany people with secondary greatness—that is, social recognition for their talents—lack primary greatness or goodness in their character. ^ref-56956\n\n---\nPage: 18\n\nThe instructor was using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.

That’s the correct lesson to learn from surprises: that the world is surprising. ^ref-8132\n\n---\nPage: 130\n\nI have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your effort depend on what you do in your firm?

You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises. Savings that aren’t earmarked for anything in particular is a hedge against life’s inevitable ability to surprise the hell out of you at the worst possible moment. ^ref-42441\n\n---\nPage: 135\n\nWorship room for error. A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over. ^ref-58434\n\n---\nPage: 135\n\nYou should like risk because it pays off over time.

Independence, to me, doesn’t mean you’ll stop working. It means you only do the work you like with people you like at the times you want for as long as you want. ^ref-16148\n\n---\nPage: 138\n\nWe own our house without a mortgage, which is the worst financial decision we’ve ever made but the best money decision we’ve ever made. Mortgage interest rates were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable. ^ref-2494\n\n---\nPage: 140\n\nI know people who think it’s insane to try to beat the market but encourage their kids to reach for the stars and try to become professional athletes.

The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns. No matter how hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss the two or three things that move the needle in your strategy. ^ref-12991\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving-AWS-SA-Associate-SAA-C03-Certification":{"title":"Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification","content":"\n[View my badge!](https://www.credly.com/badges/c3452de8-7ff6-41a5-a3e4-0a88af63e75d/public_url)\n\n**Certified**: 11th Aug 2023. \n\n## Thoughts on Content:\nGenerally, all cloud service offerings are based on familiar, existing technologies that customers would normally have hosted themselves on-premises. \n\nDue to this, it was helpful to relate service offerings to general industry status quo and requirements. \nOther notes: \n\n- **Frame learning with a perspective of [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)|\"inventing\"]] the solutions.** I did this as I progressed through the content - linking it to tech I'm already familiar with, and other ones that I wasn't yet.\n\n- **Alternate between top-down and bottom up learning.** Lead this based on curiosity and naturally arising questions. Doing so would often walk me to \"ah-ha!\" moments. \n\n- **Make use of AWS directly to validate understanding.** Use the free tier! Also, consult AWS documentation as the single sources of truth. \n\n- **On a personal experience note,** It was  interesting to learn the concepts and relate it to the server hardware's design/architecture that I work with. \n\t- Internally, we use different code names for hardware to disassociate server from service (as well as tight controls on information), so my guess is as good as any but ...\n\t- It's fun to theorise on elements such as whether aurora storage is hosted on S3 or EBS based hardware. \n\n## Thoughts on the Exam:\nIt shouldn't be overlooked that the certification is contingent on displaying understanding in an exam scenario. Unavoidably, it's also important to cover exam-taking ability.\nGeneral priorities include: \n\n- **Familiarising with common *patterns* and *anti-patterns.*** *e.g*  Discerning between the ELB, DB and storage offerings for their respective use cases. \n\n- **Get comfortable with breaking down question structure efficiently.** I found it useful to read from the questions bottom up - I felt it allowed better identification of the important details, when reading through the fluff. \n\n### Napkin Scratch AWS Project ideas:\nWhile working through the content, I had fun letting my mind wander on potential uses for the services within future project ideas. \n\n- Use an S3 bucket with [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] to store backup/archives of either the user’s input spreadsheets, or output JSON files. \n\n- Include proof of concept (and probably overdesigned) elements of high availability, fault-tolerance and disaster recovery for web-app, just to better familiarise with the concepts.\n\n- Host an OOB error page with S3 static hosting and R53 DNS fail-over, for both [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] and this [[_index|Digital Cottage website]]. \n\t- Potentially covered by free tier of AWS Shield Standard? \n\t\n- Experiment with various ways to break up the current monolithic design of projects to:\n\t- Dockerised containers. \n\t- Serverless architecture, running functions out of lambda. \n\n- Host webapp projects in \"self-healing\" auto-scaling groups, out of spot instances to ensure high availability. \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":["AWS","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Basic-Syntax-Refresher":{"title":"Bash Basic Syntax","content":"### Learning Resources: \nSkimming and pulling creating notes for TILs: \n- [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners (FreeCodeCamp Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4)\n- [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)\n\n--- \n### Hello World Scripting\nWhat is the line that all bash scripts need to start with, and why? \n?\nA shebang (`#!) declaration is required, so that the system knows what program/shell needs to be used in the running of the script. \n```\n#! /bin/bash\n```\n\nWhat permission change is required of bash script files to allow it's functionality? Explain the octal permission system and the common argument for sharing a script. \n?\nBash scripts need to have it's permission set to `executable` for the relevant principal executing. \nA common note, is to use `chmod 755` to only allow others read and execute permissions. \n```\nOctal base permissions:\n\n0 = None  \n1 = Execute  \n2 = Write  \n4 = Read\n\nThe rest are simply combinations of the base octals:\n\n3 is 1 + 2       // Execute and Write  \n5 is 1 + 4       // Execute and Read  \n6 is 2 + 4       // Write and Read  \n7 is 1 + 2 + 4   // Execute, Write, Readtip: if the number is odd, it includes Execute\n```\n\n### Variables and Conditional Arguments\n\nWhat syntax is used to receive user input to a variable? \n?\n`read`\ne.g\n```\necho First name?\nread FIRST_NAME\n\necho Last name?\nread LAST_NAME\n\necho Hello $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME\n```\n\nWhat are positional arguments and what is the `0`-th position reserved for?\n?\n- Refers to the arguments provided to shell, by commands. \n- The `0`-th argument is reserved for the shell.\n\nWhat is the syntax to make use of positional arguments?\n?\n`echo $1 $2` etc.\n```sh\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho Hello $1 $2\n```\n\n### Output Redirection\nHow do you redirect script output? \n?\nRedirects are done using \"`\u003e`\".\n\nWhat is the difference between CTRL + d and CTRL + c in interacting with terminal?\n?\n- CTRL + c  is an **interrupt**. \n- CTRL + d is a **End of File signal**, often this will log user out of terminal. \n\nWhat syntax allows appending text to an existing file, instead of overwriting it?\n?\n```\ncat B.txt \u003e\u003e A+B.txt\n```\n\n### Input Redirection\n\nWhat is a `heredocs`, what is it commonly used with and Why? \n?\n- `Heredocs` are multi-line command blocks. \n- Commonly used with `cat`. \n- This is as it allows for the printing of manipulated output/text to screen or to file by redirect. \n\nWhat is syntax for use of `Heredocs`?\n?\n- `Heredocs` use  (`\u003c\u003c`) syntax with a `DELIMITER`.\n- This has the effect of **redirecting input from a \"file\"** that users write into terminal, separated by lines and defined by the delimiters\n- Example: \n- Here, we are passing two lines of text containing an [environment variable](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/) and a command to `cat` using a here document.\n```bash\n# The script will process everything between the delimiters (in this case EOF), as input to the command. \ncat \u003c\u003c EOF\nThe current working directory is: $PWD\nYou are logged in as: $(whoami)\nEOF\n```\n```output\nThe current working directory is: /home/linuxize\nYou are logged in as: linuxize\n```\n- or through use with \"`sort`\":\n```bash\ntommy@tommy-ubuntu-pc:~/Desktop$ sort -d \u003c\u003c EOF\n\u003e C\n\u003e B\n\u003e A\n\u003e EOF\n# output: \nA\nB\nC\n```\n\nWhat does `\u003c\u003c\u003c` syntax denote?\n?\n- These are  `herestrings`, similar to heredocs but instead placing the input to be redirected on the same line as the command. \n- `Herestrings` need to be within double-quotes:\n```\nwc -w \u003c\u003c\u003c \"Hello there wordcount!\" \n```\n```output\n# output: \n3\n```\n\nWhat are the different syntax methods to provide input to a command? \n? \n- Redirect `\u003c`\n- Heredocs `\u003c\u003c`\n- Herestrings `\u003c\u003c\u003c`\n\n### Comments\nWhat is the syntax for comments in bash? \n?\n```\n# Comments can be like this\n\n: ' \nor even\nlike\nthis\nfor blocks of text\n'\n\n```\n\n### Piping\nWhat is piping? What is it's syntax? \n?\nPiping is the practice of feeding the output of one command, into another. \n```\nls -l /bin/bin | grep bash\n```\nThis will only show ls results will hence only show results that contain the string \"bash\". \n### Test Operators\nWhat syntax refers to the exit code of the last command executed? How would you print this to terminal? \n?\n- Syntax to refer to last command's exit code / return value is  `$?`\n- We can print this to terminal with `echo $?`\n\nWhat is syntax to incorporate test/evaluation operators to a command? \n?\n- We can use square brackets e.g `[ hello = hello]`. \n\t- This would evaluate to the successful exit code `0`. \n\n### Conditionals and Test Expressions (if/elif/else)\nHow would you syntactically write an `if` comparison statement for a bash script, referencing the first provided argument to the command? \n? \nExample: \n```sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then \n\techo \"asserted Herbert!\"\nelif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then\n\techo \"Enter your username!\" \nelse\n       echo \"Don't recognise user!\"\nfi\n\n# note: the commas simply denote to lowercase the variable through variable expansion. \n\n# the following showss\n```\n\nWhat is the equivalent to `len(x)` in bash?\n?\n- `${#x}`\n\nHow do you close `if` statements in bash? \n?\n`fi`. \n\nWhat is the syntax for **case statements**, noting start, end and new statement syntax. \n?\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase ${1,,} in\n\therbert | administrator)\n\t\techo \"Hello, you're the boss here!\"\n\t\t;;\n\thelp)\n\t\techo \"Just enter your username!\"\n\t\t;;\n\t*)\n\t\techo \"Hello there. You're not the boss of me.

How would you print the WHOLE array? \n?\n- Specific index:\n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[0]`\n- Entire array: \n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[@]`\n\nHow do you add items to arrays in bash? What happens when you\n?\n- You place new values into unused indexes. \n\nHow do you remove items from arrays in bash?\n?\nYou use the `unset` command. \n```bash\n\nunset fruits[2]  # Deletes the element at index 2 (orange)\n```\n\nDoes bash support slicing?\n?\nYes - for example, you can get a range of elements using `${array[start_index:end_index]}`: \n```bash\nsome_fruits=(\"${fruits[@]:1:3}\")  # Copies elements from index 1 to 3\n```\n\n### Bash Functions\n\nWhat is bash syntax for defining and calling a function?\n?\n**Definition:**\n```bash\n# Define a function named \"greet\"\ngreet() {\n    echo \"Hello, welcome to Bash functions!\"\n}\n\n```\n**Example script calling function:**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhello_world() {\n   echo 'hello, world'\n}\n\nhello_world\n```\n\nHow can you pass arguments within script and from terminal, to functions?\n? \n- Arguments can only be received from the terminal (through `$1` etc.)\n\t- Bash does not support **function arguments**, like other languages. \nExample:\n```bash \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define a function that uses $1 (local argument)\nlocal_function() {\n    local local_arg=\"$1\"\n    echo \"Local argument: $local_arg\"\n}\n\n# Call the local_function\nlocal_function \"LocalArgValue\"\n\n# Use $1 (script argument)\necho \"Argument from terminal: $1\"\n\n---\ninput:\n./example.sh TerminalArgValue\n\noutput: \nLocal argument: LocalArgValue\nArgument from terminal: TerminalArgValue\n```\n- Note that this example is scoped within the same script, and doesn't take arguments from terminal. \n\n#### Parameter and expansion\nThe hash symbol `#` and the percent signs `\n\n1. `${variable#pattern}`\n    - When you use `${variable#pattern}`, it removes the shortest match of `pattern` from the beginning of the value stored in `variable`.\n\n2. `${variable\n    - When you use `${variable\n\nHere's a brief example to illustrate further:\n\n```sh\ntext=\"Hello, World!\" \n\necho ${text#Hello,}  # Outputs: \" World!\" \necho ${text%World!}  # Outputs: \"Hello, \"\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Programming":{"title":"Bash Programming","content":"\nRefreshing my knowledge, and building my own boilerplate cheatsheets: \n\n# Index: \n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Refresher|Bash Basic Syntax Refresher]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-grep|bash-grep]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find|bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-read|bash-read]] \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean-Code":{"title":"Clean Code","content":"\nResource: [link](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.86001599Z","tags":["Programming","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Notes":{"title":"Notes","content":"### Free-for-all space for sharing notes I've created within my digital Personal Knowledge Management systems.\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification|Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification]]\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Refresher|Bash Basic Syntax Refresher]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Programming|Bash Programming]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find|bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean Code|Clean Code]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.

Each line will be split into fields, represented by each string (if delimited by space). \n- The delimiter of what represents a \"line\" or \"field\" can be changed. \n- `awk` is capable of arithmetic, often by using variable assignment also. \n- `awk` is also capable of `if-else`, `for` and `while` logic. \n# Syntax: \n## Basic syntax:\n```sh\nawk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file \u003e output-file\n```\n\n- `selection_criteria` is used to pattern match against fields (strings). \n- The pattern to be matched is denoted by single quotes (`''`). \n- Examples of `{actions}` include: \n\t- `print`: print the field. \n\t- `printf`: formatted printing similar to python. \n\t- `delete`: can be used to delete both fields and lines. \n\n# Quick Cheatsheet: \n|                       **Description**                                         |                     **Syntax**                                                                           |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Replace all occurrences of a pattern with a replacement string | `{print $0 ~ /pattern/ ? replacement : $0}`                                                    |\n| Delete all lines that match a pattern                          | `{if ($0 ~ /pattern/) next; print $0}`                                                         |\n| Print only the lines that match a pattern                      | `{if ($0 ~ /pattern/) print $0}`                                                               |\n| Insert a line before or after the line that matches a pattern  | `{if ($0 ~ /pattern/) {print line; print $0}}` or `{if ($0 ~ /pattern/) print $0; print line}` |\n| Append a line to the end of the file                           | `{print line}`                                                                                 |\n| Change the delimiter from white space to another character   | `awk -F'new_char_here' '{ command }' file.txt`                                                 |\n| To only print the last field per line, use `$NF`           | `awk '{print $NF }' file.txt`                                                                                   |\n\n**Common commands/arguments:**\n*Example syntax incorporation:*\n```sh\n#print the first and last fields\nawk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt\n\n#print all lines, with line numbers\nawk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt \n\n#print lines from 3 to 6\nawk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt\n\n#count the number of lines in a file\nawk 'END { print NR }' test.txt\n\n```\n\n\n***\n# User-defined and  Shell Generated Variables\n**`END`**: \n\t- `END` is a special block used to specify an action once all records are processed. It's useful when looking to validate an entire file, such as by counting number of lines. \n\n**Positional variables:** \n\t- When Awk processes a line/record, it will split each delimited set of characters (string) into variables. \n\t- \"`$1`\", \"`$2`\", \"`$3`\" etc. refer to each field within the record -- it is **NOT** zero-indexed. \n\t- \"`$0`\" refers to the entire input record (or line) in \"awk\". \n\n**Variable assignment**:\n```sh\n# syntax:\nvariable_name=value\n\n# e.g:\nawk '{ name = $1; age = $2; print \"Name:\", name, \"Age:\", age }' data.txt\n\n# you can also declare variables with defined values, prior to processing: \nawk -v age=25 '{ print \"Age:\", age }' data.txt\n\n```\n\n**Common special variables:**\n- **NR:** NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records.\n- **NF:** NF command keeps a count of the number of fields within the current input record.\n- **FS:** FS command contains the field separator character which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is “white space”, meaning space and tab characters. \n- **RS:** RS command stores the current record separator character. Since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline.\n- **OFS:** OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints them. The default is a blank space. \n# Deleting with `awk`\n`awk` can be used to delete both fields or lines. \n\n**Deleting per pattern:**\n```sh\n#The following command will delete all lines that contain the word \"foo\":\nawk '/foo/ delete' input.txt\n```\n\n**Deleting per positional variable:**\n```sh\n#The following deletes the second field from each line, but only after printing it first:\nawk '/foo/ {print $2} delete $1' input.txt\n```\n\n*Notes:*\n- The `delete` action is applied after all other awk actions have been executed.\n- It only be used to delete fields or records that have already been created.\n- It cannot delete fields or records that are created by other awk actions, such as  `split`.\n\n# Conditional logic: \n**Example if-else logic:**\n```sh\nawk '{  \nif(condition_here)  \n{  \nprint \"condition matched!\"  \n}  \nelse  \n{  \nprint \"condition not matched!\"  \n}  \n   \n}' sample_data.txt\n```\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["bash"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find":{"title":"bash-find","content":"\n##### Resources: \n- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-command-in-linux-with-examples/)\n\n---\n\n# Syntax:\n\n```bash\n\nfind [where to start searching from]\n [expression determines what to find] [-options] [what to find]\n\ne.g \nfind \"$MD_DIRECTORY\" -name '*.md' -exec echo \"File is: {}\" \\;\n```\n\n- By default, `find` searches recursively to include sub-directories and files too. \n# Cheatsheet: \n\n| **Description**                                             | **Syntax**                                                       |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Search for all files of a pattern                           | `find ./GFG -name *.txt`                                         |\n| Placeholder for \"current file path of found object\" -\u003e `{}` | `find \"$MD_DIRECTORY\" -name '*.md' -exec echo \"File is: {}\" \\;

Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n````\nsudo snap install hugo\n````\n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n   \n   * Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n   * [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n\n````\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n````\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n\ta. Confirm where GO installed itself (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\t\n\tb. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\t\n\tc. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\n   a. Get the modules required:\n   \n   ````\n   go get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   b. Install from repo:\n   \n   ````\n   go get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   c. Test with:\n   \n   ````\n   hugo-obsidian version\n   ````\n\n3. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n   \n   ````\n   make serve\n   ````\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n   \n   * I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n   * My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n   * All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n#### Automating export:\nHere's a quick and dirty bash script to clears the repo's copy of the vault and index files, to copy in the current ones from the obsidian vault location. \n\nAutomating this process means the creation process of posts is simple:\n1. Write/edit posts and index file as notes in obsidian\n2. Run `make serve` to host local render of website. \n3. Run script in terminal to update the browser render live. \n4. To post, push on git! \n\nFeel free to adapt if the idea is useful.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nSOURCE_PATH=~/path/to/source\nDESTINATION_PATH=~/path/to/destination\n\n# Delete all files in the target export folder - public_digital_garden is the folder that i've placed all my obsidian notes in (both in my vault and the quartz folder). Adapt for your folder name. \n\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden/*\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/_index.md\n\n# Copy index file and public folder from obsidian vault to export folder for git pushing\ncp -r \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\ncp \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/_index.md \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\n```\n---\n#### References: \nResources:\n* https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\n* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart\n* [Publishing your Vault Online With Quartz](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) - [Brandon Boswell](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["obsidian","quartz"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Dreams-without-goals-are-just-dreams-and-ultimately-they-fuel-disappointment":{"title":"\"Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment\"","content":"\n[YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LspuaSV_qII) \n\n\u003eDreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment.

This will lead to a sense of progress. \n- Create sub-goals along a map, as this allows you to track progress tangibly. \n- Shrink goals as small as possible, as the smaller the units of work, the better you can track it.\n- This way, each small task unit can simulate the \"step-after-step\" or \"rep-after-rep\" mentalities echoed by runners and Arnold Schwarzenegger respectively.\n\n**Motion builds momentum -- utilise small victories, even if simple, to lubricate the motion towards the larger ones:**\n- Author example: \n\tSetting a timer for 60 seconds, to push self to write any amount of words, towards a longer writing goal. \n*My own anecdotes:*\n- Solving easy coding problems, to lubricate the logic muscles and reduce friction to coding sessions/tackling harder problems or projects.\n- Short gym workouts, to ease into larger ones. \n- Short \"just get out the house\" cardio sessions, that turn themselves into twice a week longer ones. \n\n**The paralysis of perfectionism:**\n- Perfectionism signals flaws and failure to your own feedback systems -- this kills motivation, and stifles productivity. \n- The quality of user-generated output, is potentially only accessible by first \"pouring out the bad stuff\", and getting past the low quality generation of content. \n- Are my ambitious goal setting methods, with tight personal deadlines (shoot for the moon and reach the stars method) not conducive to overall productivity due to this effect? \n\n**The lack of dialogue over shared stuckness:**\n- Social media is particularly terrible for this - as there are no highlighting of stuckness and slowness, despite it being a natural phenomena to progress. \n- This \"pluralistic ignorance\" is amplified as only successes are shared, from a network of people, in a way that it is consistently visible, implying a normalcy that is false. \n- Breakdown the pluralistic ignorance, by breaking the silos between people, and opening dialogue between the frictions, stuckpoints and obstacles!\n\n**A long journey is rarely a linear path:**\n- Success is not often through a single golden ticket route -- by this strict binary definition, success would seldom happen. \n\t- Define success through a **system**, bring the locus of control internal -- and measure success by elements in which you have control.\n\t- e.g Time spent coding, problems solved, projects created etc. \n\n**Quantity is a unavoidable precursor to quality**:\n- You NEED the misses, to have successes in aggregate. \n- Try multiple approaches, and try different things, in order to find the right path. \n\n**Steady practice evolving into a sense of no progression - plateaus**:\n- Habituation could lead to this effect -- you gain expertise to the routine and system, as opposed to reacting to the target challenges. \n- Comfort, provided from doing the same thing over and over again, turns into complacency that leads to stagnation. \n\n**Find what really matters -- every topic contains an overwhelming volume of information**\n- Learn to strip away and set artificial constraints on input data, as to develop effective comprehension and productivity. \n\n**Negative Stereotype Effect:**\n- Awareness that you belong to a group that have a stereotype of being poor within that community, it CREATES the effect of increased metal stuckness and low morale. \n\t- Do not let the stereotype effect define your potential -- recognise it, maybe, as a challenge, but not a defining characteristic. \n\n**Action above all**\n- Being stuck is about being in one place, but wanting to be somewhere else. \n- Ultimately, the thing you have to do the most, is **ACT** and move towards that direction. \n- In the act of doing, you show to yourself inserts change and potential -- whereas sitting still and thinking, simply does nothing but perpetuates the current situation. \n\n**Hitting the button to shuffle the letters**\n- Sometimes, you just need a different perspective to things. \n\n**Having, and achieving any goal, even if unrelated to the main muse, provides movement that can aid unstucking**:\n- It allows your mind to realise, you are NOT stuck. \n# Takeways:\n## Strategies against stuckness: \n\n**Be aware of the \"U-shape\" trap to feelings of progress.**\n- The middle of the journey will be the most difficult, and also where the majority of these strategies can be applied. \n\n**Break up and shrink goals and tasks to be as granular as possible. This provides an effective way to track and sense progress.** \n- Create a map towards goals, comprised of these granular tasks as it's units. This allows a visualisation of total progress, expressed in granular, seemingly unimportant completions. \n\n**Never aim for perfection.** \n- Perfectionism is a detriment to all systems. It provides only compounding negative feedback, as anything that is not perfect, is a failure. \n- Utilise small victories, no matter how novel or even unrelated, to build movement. \n- Be aware of the requirement to **leverage quantity, to find quality** (pouring the bad out first). \n- Action, no matter how unsure the direction, is often better than to sit and wondering will maintain cirucmstances -- It provides the circumstance exposure to **potential**. \n\n**Fight against habituation, which ultimately, leads to stagnation.** \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["resonance-journal","podcast","psychology"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Jony-Ivy-The-Man-behind-Apple-Design":{"title":"Jony Ivy - The Man behind Apple Design","content":"\n\n\n![YouTube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqhfFNTtuv0)\n\n- Steve Jobs and John allowed design teams to butt heads and have more of a leading role in product design, which required engineering teams to accommodate and compromise, for design goals. \n- Apple's design is rooted in Bauhaus design concepts. \n- This design first thinking lead to the intention of humanising the technology -- apple's use of transparent iMac's resonated through the industry, and was then followed in suit by many other companies (gameboys etc). \n- Steve called Jony his \"spiritual partner at Apple\" -- his opinion was well respected as one of, if not it's leading second voice at the company. \n- Jony conceptualised the iPhone model, with an \"infinity pool type design to the display\" privately to Steve as to avoid having the idea stifled by engineering. \n- He was even knighted!\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["resonance-journal","design","Creation"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Life-Advice-From-Bjarne-Stroustrup":{"title":" Life Advice From Bjarne Stroustrup","content":"\n\n![YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QxI-RP6-HM)\n\n- Be flexible, patient and have a balanced life.

[Coding is NOT study!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HggHXFnPOY4) It's an art, and should be treated as a creative hobby. \n\t- Program what you love, until you love coding!\n\n\n### Other key parallels: \n- Having a seat at the table among those who are admirably impressive, and masters of their craft. \n- The \"git gud\" grind, and the satisfaction from being someone who can answer questions and show other people how to get better. \n- The nugget of dopamine that comes from \"winning\" -- solving a problem and making progress. \n- Reaching achievements such as rank/elo -\u003e certificates, projects, levelling up jobs or promotions.\n- Becoming really good at something, and seeing personal stature rise within the community as you become better, more experienced -- **being able to productively butthead with other brilliant peers.**  \n- Coding has it's own meta, arguments and community similar to games. \n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["resonance-journal","productivity","paradigm-shift","programming"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Resonance-Journal":{"title":"Resonance Journal","content":"### A free-for-all list of all the content I consume that resonates with me. \n\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment|Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Edsger Dijkstra - One-Day Workweek|Edsger Dijkstra - One-Day Workweek]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)|Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Go all the way|Go all the way]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/HiddenBrain - Strategies Against Ruts And Stuckness|HiddenBrain - Strategies Against Ruts And Stuckness]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Jony Ivy - The Man behind Apple Design|Jony Ivy - The Man behind Apple Design]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Life Advice From Bjarne Stroustrup|Life Advice From Bjarne Stroustrup]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Making a Portable Mac Mini - Scott Yu-Jan|Making a Portable Mac Mini - Scott Yu-Jan]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Oppenheimer (Movie)|Oppenheimer (Movie)]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Replacing entertainment habits with coding|Replacing entertainment habits with coding]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Talent is a pursued interest|Talent is a pursued interest]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/We are what we repeatedly do|We are what we repeatedly do]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Why Socrates Hated Democracy|Why Socrates Hated Democracy]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.864016105Z","tags":["MOC"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Talent-is-a-pursued-interest":{"title":"Talent is a pursued interest","content":"\n### Quote: \n\n\u003e Talent is a pursued interest.

It explores how it was likely made possible, through peer accounts of how he would be working on several things simultaneously, in bursts of intense deep work sessions. \n- David Goggins often proposes the concept of \"callousing your mind\", asserting that individuals need to be intentionally exposed to friction and discomfort; and in doing so, would develop the toughness to increase capacity to create value. \n\nThough I have had many productive results from approaching work sessions with this perspective (CS50!), the uncompromising standard for input intensity and result output can also set things up for failure. Specifically, consistently not meeting targets can have an accumulative demoralising effect; whether due to a persistent bug, mental/focus blocks, or simply poor estimation of the task at hand. \n\nThis is accumulative effect is compounding, and creates a negative feedback loop -- which arguably makes for an ineffective system by design. \n\n### Coding/working without expectations\nThis concept was first introduced to me by [YouTuber BigBoxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0eB7tMkvs4\u0026t=16s). During a time when I was banging my head against a bash script, stubbornly telling myself I needed to finish it yet severely underestimating the scope, it ended up spilling over multiple days, into weeks. It opened up my perspective to the value in having a flexible approach. \n\nIt made learning, practice and the general pursuit towards my learning goals demotivating, and lead to way more friction to just get seated and to start. \n\nIn this instance, I took the advice and decided to spend some time doing CodeWar problems. Each solved problem provided a nice dopamine boost, and gave me the confidence to throw myself back into the head-banging stuff. \n\nThough, there's likely a trap in here that could lead oneself into \"feeling productive\" without actually creating meaningful, high-quality value output -- to this point, this (and the former) approach would only generate it's most effective value when used within an en effective, alternating strategy guided by intuitive feeling. \n\n### Ultimately... \nThe critical thing is likely that **you keep going, and do so consistently**. The best application of these two schools of thoughts is likely to use both interchangeably, based on factors such as time/stamina/focus available -- mentally, you won't be in a single static frame of mind along the journey after all, and will have moments where you're more motivated or available than others. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-09-20T12:55:37.868016219Z","tags":["Productivity"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Inspiration-Vault":{"title":"Inspiration Vault","content":"\n#### Inspiring figures:\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.
