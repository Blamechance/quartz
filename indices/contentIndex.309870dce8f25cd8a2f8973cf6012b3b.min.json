But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces. The person who cannot resist food or alcohol, or whose mind is constantly focused on sex, is not free to direct his or her psychic energy. ^ref-34014\n\nNote:\n\nThe value against natural impulses\n\n\n---\nPage: 29\n\nSubmission to genetic programming can become quite dangerous, because it leaves us helpless. A person who cannot override genetic instructions when necessary is always vulnerable. Instead of deciding how to act in terms of personal goals, he has to surrender to the things that his body has been programmed (or misprogrammed) to do. One must particularly achieve control over instinctual drives to achieve a healthy independence of society, for as long as we respond predictably to what feels good and what feels bad, it is easy for others to exploit our preferences for their own ends. ^ref-31231\n\nNote:\n\nBeing unable to act against what is comfortable and comes naturally, will lead to being at the whim of those forces, and not navigating to where one WANTS to go, but rather where their natural behaviour takes them.\nPersonal success however, is often built on doing what is uncomfortable, even if only at first.\n\n\n---\nPage: 27\n\nAs Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not. Socialization, or the transformation of a human organism into a person who functions successfully within a particular social system, cannot be avoided. The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments. And the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longer can imagine themselves breaking any of its rules. ^ref-45050\n\nNote:\n\nOn value of socialisation of populations\n\n\n---\nPage: 30\n\nThe solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one’s own powers. ^ref-23837\n\nNote:\n\nBe internally motivated, to avoid external disruption to goals and manipulation .\n\n\n---\nPage: 37\n\nself-delusions—lies that an overly receptive mind tells itself. ^ref-14258\n\n---\nPage: 38\n\nWith ^ref-27581\n\n---\nPage: 28\n\nIt is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. ^ref-4943\n\n---\nPage: 36\n\nOver the endless dark centuries of its evolution, the human nervous system has become so complex that it is now able to affect its own states, making it to a certain extent functionally independent of its genetic blueprint and of the objective environment. A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness. ^ref-24557\n\n---\nPage: 39\n\nWe may call intentions the force that keeps information in consciousness ordered. Intentions arise in consciousness whenever a person is aware of desiring something or wanting to accomplish something. Intentions are also bits of information, shaped either by biological needs or by internalized social goals. They act as magnetic fields, moving attention toward some objects and away from others, keeping our mind focused on some stimuli in preference to others. We often call the manifestation of intentionality by other names, such as instinct, need, drive, or desire. But these are all explanatory terms, telling us why people behave in certain ways. Intention is a more neutral and descriptive term; it doesn’t say why a person wants to do a certain thing, but simply states that he does. ^ref-23353\n\n---\nPage: 41\n\nIndividuals who depart from the norms—heroes, saints, sages, artists, and poets, as well as madmen and criminals—look for different things in life than most others do. The existence of people like these shows that consciousness can be ordered in terms of different goals and intentions. Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality. ^ref-58440\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Books/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People-Covey":{"title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Covey","content":"# Notes:\n\n---\n\n### Highlights\nPage: 10\n\nThe Character Ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character. But shortly after World War 1 the basic view of success shifted from the Character Ethic to what we might call the Personality Ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. ^ref-18991\n\nNote:\n\nCharacter ethic vs Personality ethic\n\n\n---\nPage: 14\n\nMany people with secondary greatness—that is, social recognition for their talents—lack primary greatness or goodness in their character. ^ref-56956\n\n---\nPage: 18\n\nThe instructor was using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.

That’s the correct lesson to learn from surprises: that the world is surprising. ^ref-8132\n\n---\nPage: 130\n\nI have had several occasions to ask founders and participants in innovative start-ups a question: To what extent will the outcome of your effort depend on what you do in your firm?

You don’t need a specific reason to save. It’s great to save for a car, or a downpayment, or a medical emergency. But saving for things that are impossible to predict or define is one of the best reasons to save. Everyone’s life is a continuous chain of surprises.

A gap between what could happen in the future and what you need to happen in the future in order to do well is what gives you endurance, and endurance is what makes compounding magic over time. Room for error often looks like a conservative hedge, but if it keeps you in the game it can pay for itself many times over. ^ref-58434\n\n---\nPage: 135\n\nYou should like risk because it pays off over time.

Mortgage interest rates were absurdly low when we bought our house. Any rational advisor would recommend taking advantage of cheap money and investing extra savings in higher-return assets, like stocks. But our goal isn’t to be coldly rational; just psychologically reasonable. ^ref-2494\n\n---\nPage: 140\n\nI know people who think it’s insane to try to beat the market but encourage their kids to reach for the stars and try to become professional athletes.

The reason is because the world is driven by tails—a few variables account for the majority of returns.

Doing so would often walk me to \"ah-ha!\" moments. \n\n- Similar of my experience working at AWS, documentation of services is **robust** and should be used as the first contact sources of truth.\n\t- Diving into the FAQs/documentation would often lead to any context or answers I was missing. \n\n- Make use of AWS directly to validate understanding. \n\t- Use the free tier! \n\t- Use the documentation as sources of truth. \n\n- It was also quite interesting to learn the concepts and relate it to the server hardware's design/architecture that I work with, making guesses in how the HWeng teams translated requirements into the design. \n\t- Internally, we use different code names for hardware to disassociate server from service (as well as tight controls on information), so my guess is as good as any but ...\n\t- It's fun to theorise on elements such as whether aurora storage is hosted on S3 or EBS based hardware. \n\n## Thoughts on the Exam:\nIt shouldn't be overlooked that the certification is contingent on displaying understanding in an exam scenario. Unavoidably, it's also important to cover exam-taking ability.\nGeneral priorities include: \n\n- Familiarising with common *patterns* and *anti-patterns.* \n\t- *e.g*  Discerning between the ELB, DB and storage offerings for their respective use cases. \n\n- Get comfortable with breaking down question structure efficiently. \n\t- I found it useful to read from the questions bottom up - I felt it allowed better identification of the important details, when reading through the fluff. \n\n### Napkin Scratch AWS Project ideas:\nWhile working through the content, I had fun letting my mind wander on potential uses for the services within future project ideas. \n\n- Use an S3 bucket with [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] to store backup/archives of either the user’s input spreadsheets, or output JSON files. \n\n- Include proof of concept (and probably overdesigned) elements of high availability, fault-tolerance and disaster recovery for web-app, just to better familiarise with the concepts.\n\n- Host an OOB error page with S3 static hosting and R53 DNS fail-over, for both [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] and this [[_index|Digital Cottage website]]. \n\t- Potentially covered by free tier of AWS Shield Standard? \n\t\n- Experiment with various ways to break up the current monolithic design of projects to:\n\t- Dockerised containers. \n\t- Serverless architecture, running functions out of lambda. \n\n- Host webapp projects in \"self-healing\" auto-scaling groups, out of spot instances to ensure high availability. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["AWS","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Basic-Syntax-Notes":{"title":"Bash Basic Syntax Notes","content":"### Learning Resources: \nSkimming and pulling creating notes for TILs: \n[Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners (FreeCodeCamp Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4)\n[linuxhint 3 hr video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7BufAVwDiM)\nhttps://learn.acloud.guru/course/admin-guide-to-bash-scripting/overview\n[Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)\n\n--- \n### Hello World Scripting\nWhat is the line that all bash scripts need to start with, and why? \n?\nA shebang (`#!) declaration is required, so that the system knows what program/shell needs to be used in the running of the script. \n```\n#! /bin/bash\n```\n\nWhat permission change is required of bash script files to allow it's functionality? Explain the octal permission system and the common argument for sharing a script. \n?\nBash scripts need to have it's permission set to `executable` for the relevant principal executing. \nA common note, is to use `chmod 755` to only allow others read and execute permissions. \n```\nOctal base permissions:\n\n0 = None  \n1 = Execute  \n2 = Write  \n4 = Read\n\nThe rest are simply combinations of the base octals:\n\n3 is 1 + 2       // Execute and Write  \n5 is 1 + 4       // Execute and Read  \n6 is 2 + 4       // Write and Read  \n7 is 1 + 2 + 4   // Execute, Write, Readtip: if the number is odd, it includes Execute\n```\n\n### Variables and Conditional Arguments\n\nWhat syntax is used to receive user input to a variable? \n?\n`read`\ne.g\n```\necho First name?\nread FIRST_NAME\n\necho Last name?\nread LAST_NAME\n\necho Hello $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME\n```\n\nWhat are positional arguments and what is the `0`-th position reserved for?\n?\n- Refers to the arguments provided to shell, by commands. \n- The `0`-th argument is reserved for the shell, like the following: \n\t- ![[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Private/attachments/Bash-lecture-notes.png|Private/attachments/Bash-lecture-notes.png]]\n\nWhat is the syntax to make use of positional arguments?\n?\n`echo $1 $2` etc.\n```sh\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho Hello $1 $2\n```\n\n### Output Redirection\nHow do you redirect script output? \n?\nRedirects are done using `\u003e`. \n\nWhat is the difference betwen CTRL + d and CTRL + c?\n?\n- CTRL + c  is an **interrupt**. \n- CTRL + d is a **End of File signal**, often this will log user out of terminal. \n\nWhat syntax allows appending text to an existing file, instead of overwriting it?\n?\n```\ncat B.txt \u003e\u003e A+B.txt\n```\n\n### Input Redirection\n\nWhat is a `heredocs`, what is it commonly used with and Why? \n?\n- `Heredocs` are multi-line command blocks. \n- Commonly used with `cat`. \n- This is as it allows for the printing of manipulated output/text to screen or to file by redirect. \n\nWhat is syntax for use of `Heredocs`?\n?\n- `Heredocs` use  (`\u003c\u003c`) syntax with a `DELIMITER`.\n- This has the effect of **redirecting input from a \"file\"** that users write into terminal, separated by lines and defined by the delimiters\n- Example: \n- Here, we are passing two lines of text containing an [environment variable](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/) and a command to `cat` using a here document.\n```bash\n# The script will process everything between the delimiters (in this case EOF), as input to the command. \ncat \u003c\u003c EOF\nThe current working directory is: $PWD\nYou are logged in as: $(whoami)\nEOF\n```\n```output\nThe current working directory is: /home/linuxize\nYou are logged in as: linuxize\n```\n- or through use with \"sed\":\n```bash\ntommy@tommy-ubuntu-pc:~/Desktop$ sort -d \u003c\u003c EOF\n\u003e C\n\u003e B\n\u003e A\n\u003e EOF\n# output: \nA\nB\nC\n```\n\nWhat does `\u003c\u003c\u003c` syntax denote?\n?\n- These are  `herestrings`, similar to heredocs but instead placing the input to be redirected on the same line as the command. \n- `Herestrings` need to be within double-quotes:\n```\nwc -w \u003c\u003c\u003c \"Hello there wordcount!\" \n```\n```output\n# output: \n3\n```\n\nWhat are the different syntax methods to provide input to a command? \n? \n- Redirect `\u003c`\n- Heredocs `\u003c\u003c`\n- Herestrings `\u003c\u003c\u003c`\n\n### Comments\nWhat is the syntax for comments in bash? \n?\n```\n# Comments can be like this\n\n: ' \nor even\nlike\nthis\nfor blocks of text\n'\n\n```\n\n### Piping\nWhat is piping? What is it's syntax? \n?\nPiping is the practice of feeding the output of one command, into another. \n```\nls -l /bin/bin | grep bash\n```\nThis will only show ls results will hence only show results that contain the string \"bash\". \n\n\n\n### Test Operators\nWhat syntax refers to the exit code of the last command executed? How would you print this to terminal? \n?\n- Syntax to refer to last command's exit code / return value is  `$?`\n- We can print this to terminal with `echo $?`\n\nWhat is syntax to incorporate test/evaluation operators to a command? \n?\n- We can use square brackets e.g `[ hello = hello]`. \n\t- This would evaluate to the successful exit code `0`. \n\n### Conditionals and Test Expressions (if/elif/else)\nHow would you syntactically write an `if` comparison statement for a bash script, referencing the first provided argument to the command? \n? \nExample: \n```sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then \n\techo \"asserted Herbert!\"\nelif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then\n\techo \"Enter your username!\" \nelse\n       echo \"Don't recognise user!\"\nfi\n\n# note: the commas simply denote to lowercase the variable through variable expansion. \n\n# the following showss\n```\n\nWhat is the equivalent to `len(x)` in bash?\n?\n- `${#x}`\n\nHow do you close `if` statements in bash? \n?\n`fi`. \n\nWhat is the syntax for **case statements**, noting start, end and new statement syntax. \n?\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase ${1,,} in\n\therbert | administrator)\n\t\techo \"Hello, you're the boss here!\"\n\t\t;;\n\thelp)\n\t\techo \"Just enter your username!\"\n\t\t;;\n\t*)\n\t\techo \"Hello there. You're not the boss of me.

How would you print the WHOLE array? \n?\n- Specific index:\n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[0]`\n- Entire array: \n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[@]`\n\nHow do you add items to arrays in bash? What happens when you\n?\n- You place new values into unused indexes. \n\nHow do you remove items from arrays in bash?\n?\nYou use the `unset` command. \n```bash\n\nunset fruits[2]  # Deletes the element at index 2 (orange)\n```\n\nDoes bash support slicing?\n?\nYes - for example, you can get a range of elements using `${array[start_index:end_index]}`: \n```bash\nsome_fruits=(\"${fruits[@]:1:3}\")  # Copies elements from index 1 to 3\n```\n\n### Bash Functions\n\nWhat is bash syntax for defining and calling a function?\n?\n**Definition:**\n```bash\n# Define a function named \"greet\"\ngreet() {\n    echo \"Hello, welcome to Bash functions!\"\n}\n\n```\n**Example script calling function:**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhello_world() {\n   echo 'hello, world'\n}\n\nhello_world\n```\n\nHow can you pass arguments within script and from terminal, to functions?\n? \n- Arguments can only be received from the terminal (through `$1` etc.)\n\t- Bash does not support **function arguments**, like other languages. \nExample:\n```bash \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define a function that uses $1 (local argument)\nlocal_function() {\n    local local_arg=\"$1\"\n    echo \"Local argument: $local_arg\"\n}\n\n# Call the local_function\nlocal_function \"LocalArgValue\"\n\n# Use $1 (script argument)\necho \"Argument from terminal: $1\"\n\n---\ninput:\n./example.sh TerminalArgValue\n\noutput: \nLocal argument: LocalArgValue\nArgument from terminal: TerminalArgValue\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Programming":{"title":"Bash Programming","content":"\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Notes|Bash Basic Syntax Notes]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean-Code":{"title":"Clean Code","content":"\nResource: [link](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["Programming","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Notes":{"title":"Notes","content":"### Free-for-all space for sharing notes I've created within my digital Personal Knowledge Management systems.\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification|Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification]]\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Notes|Bash Basic Syntax Notes]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Programming|Bash Programming]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean Code|Clean Code]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.

Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n````\nsudo snap install hugo\n````\n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n   \n   * Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n   * [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n\n````\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n````\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n\ta. Confirm where GO installed itself (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\t\n\tb. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\t\n\tc. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\n   a. Get the modules required:\n   \n   ````\n   go get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   b. Install from repo:\n   \n   ````\n   go get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   c. Test with:\n   \n   ````\n   hugo-obsidian version\n   ````\n\n3. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n   \n   ````\n   make serve\n   ````\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n   \n   * I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n   * My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n   * All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n#### Automating export:\nHere's a quick and dirty bash script to clears the repo's copy of the vault and index files, to copy in the current ones from the obsidian vault location. \n\nAutomating this process means the creation process of posts is simple:\n1. Write/edit posts and index file as notes in obsidian\n2. Run `make serve` to host local render of website. \n3. Run script in terminal to update the browser render live. \n4. To post, push on git! \n\nFeel free to adapt if the idea is useful.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nSOURCE_PATH=~/path/to/source\nDESTINATION_PATH=~/path/to/destination\n\n# Delete all files in the target export folder - public_digital_garden is the folder that i've placed all my obsidian notes in (both in my vault and the quartz folder). Adapt for your folder name. \n\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden/*\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/_index.md\n\n# Copy index file and public folder from obsidian vault to export folder for git pushing\ncp -r \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\ncp \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/_index.md \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\n```\n---\n#### References: \nResources:\n* https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\n* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart\n* [Publishing your Vault Online With Quartz](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) - [Brandon Boswell](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["obsidian","quartz"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Christopher-Nolans-Oppenheimer":{"title":"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer","content":"\n- Super inspiring to be reminded of the incredibly impressive figures that spurred the [scientific revolution of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_in_science). \n\t- Reminded me of my fascination as a younger child, with inventors and their creations made through the magic of science and logic. \n- Very interesting to draw parallels in community and purpose of the science scene of then, and the start-up/tech culture of today. \n- Subtle parallels exist, such as:\n\t- Individuals creating for the sake of progress and personal ego, with little priority on the ethics and politics surrounding it -- a commonly voiced concern with AGI development. \n- Oppenheimer seemed an incredibly intelligent and accomplished visionary, who occupied a leadership/orchestrative enabled by his multi-faceted [expertise and interests](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4841924-isidore-i-rabi-a-close-friend-and-admirer-of-oppenheimer) -- somewhat similar to individuals like Steve Jobs. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.613332411Z","tags":["resonance-journal","Movie"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Dreams-without-goals-are-just-dreams-and-ultimately-they-fuel-disappointment":{"title":"\"Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment\"","content":"\n[YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LspuaSV_qII) \n\n\u003eDreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment.

If all possible branches of possibilities to tackling debugging are exhausted, use AI to minimise time wasted slamming head into keyboard. \n\t- Had many days of frustration lost over simple debugs -- I'm opting to consider this as equivalent value to having a mentor, in the interest of accelerating productivity. \n\n---\n\n### Useful Tools:\n\n- Youtube video summarising tools:\n    \n    - [summarize.tech](https://www.summarize.tech/)\n    \n    - [Glasp](https://glasp.co/youtube-summary)\n    \n- GPT3.5 Agent\n    - [AgentGPT 🤖](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.617332515Z","tags":["AI","learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets":{"title":"Thoughts And Mental Snippets","content":"### My written posts and other mental snippets. \n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Inspiration Vault|Inspiration Vault]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Personally Defined Rules For Learning With AI|Personally Defined Rules For Learning With AI]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-19T12:29:39.617332515Z","tags":["MOC"]}}
