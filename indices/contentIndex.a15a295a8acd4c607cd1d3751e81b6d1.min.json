It's a work in progress! \n\n\n##  Recent Posts: \n- [Setting Up Obsidian-based Digital Garden website](obsidian://open?vault=obsidian_blamechance_wiki\u0026file=Digital_Garden_(Public)%2FSetting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website)\n- [[Digital_Garden_(Public)/Setting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website|Setting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website]]\n- [[Digital_Garden_(Public)/Setting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website|Setting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T07:40:09.159488372Z","tags":[]},"/Digital_Garden_Public/Setting-Up-Obsidian-based-Digital-Garden-website":{"title":"Setting Up Obsidian-based Digital Garden website","content":"  \n### First attempt:\nOn first attempt, I was looking to replicate the following\n\n- [Publishing your Vault Online With Quartz](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)\n- I found this method to have a few too many gaps in instruction to replicate his home brewed solution for selective upload of vault files.\n\n\n### Final solution\nI ended up deciding to stand on the shoulders of [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) for the time being and use his incredible Quartz Repo. \n- Currently, this means manually copying in the \"public\" folder of my obsidian vault, each time I want to upload.\n- Eventually I plan to automate this with my own cron-job based script.\n\nResources:\n- https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n- https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n- https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/\n- https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\n\n  \n\n---\n\n## Linux (ubuntu) installation:\n\nIn the event it's useful for others, here are the steps I took to get it all going.\n\nFirstly, fork and clone the following repo locally:\n`https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz`\n\n\n### 1. Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n```\nsudo snap install hugo\n```\n\n  \n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n\t- Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n\t- [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n```\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n```\n\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n1. Confirm where go installed it's folder (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\n2. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\n3. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n\t`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\ta. Get the modules required:\n\t```\n\tgo get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n\t```\n\tb. Install from repo:\n\t```\n\tgo get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n\t```\n\tc. Test with:\n\t```\n\thugo-obsidian version\n\t```\n\n4. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n\t```\n\tmake serve\n\t```\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n\t- I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n\t- My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n\t- All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n\n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/). \n","lastmodified":"2023-07-18T07:40:09.159488372Z","tags":["obsidian","quartz"]}}
