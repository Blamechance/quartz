Doing so would often walk me to \"ah-ha!\" moments. \n\n- Similar of my experience working at AWS, documentation of services is **robust** and should be used as the first contact sources of truth.\n\t- Diving into the FAQs/documentation would often lead to any context or answers I was missing. \n\n- Make use of free tier and tinker within the AWS console, to anchor learned content. \n\t- I made little notes along the way for ways I can make use of services within personal projects. \n\n- It was also quite interesting to learn the concepts and relate it to the server hardware's design/architecture that I work with, making guesses in how the HWeng teams translated requirements into the design. \n\t- Internally, we use different code names for hardware to disassociate server from service (as well as tight controls on information), so my guess is as good as any but ...\n\t- It's fun to theorise on elements such as whether aurora storage is hosted on S3 or EBS based hardware. \n\nThese things helped me understand concepts on a deeper level, particularly with:\n1. What it does\n2. Why it was developed; and \n3. Where it's value/role slots into cloud architecture design. \n\n## Thoughts on the Exam:\nIt shouldn't be overlooked that the certification is contingent on displaying understanding in an exam scenario. Unavoidably, it's also important to cover exam-taking ability.\nGeneral priorities include: \n\n- Familiarising with common *patterns* and *anti-patterns.* \n\t- *e.g*  Discerning between the ELB, DB and storage offerings for their respective use cases. \n\n- Get comfortable with breaking down question structure efficiently. \n\t- I found it useful to read from the questions bottom up - I felt it allowed better identification of the important details, when reading through the fluff. \n\n### Napkin Scratch AWS Project ideas:\nWhile working through the content, I had fun letting my mind wander on potential uses for the services within future project ideas. \n\n- Use an S3 bucket with [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] to store backup/archives of either the user’s input spreadsheets, or output JSON files. \n\n- Include proof of concept (and probably overdesigned) elements of high availability, fault-tolerance and disaster recovery for web-app, just to better familiarise with the concepts.\n\n- Host an OOB error page with S3 static hosting and R53 DNS fail-over, for both [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] and this [[_index|Digital Cottage website]]. \n\t- Potentially covered by free tier of AWS Shield Standard? \n\t\n- Experiment with various ways to break up the current monolithic design of projects to:\n\t- Dockerised containers. \n\t- Serverless architecture, running functions out of lambda. \n\n- Host webapp projects in \"self-healing\" auto-scaling groups, out of spot instances to ensure high availability. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["AWS","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean-Code":{"title":"Clean Code","content":"\nResource: [link](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["Programming","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Notes":{"title":"Notes","content":"### Free-for-all space for sharing notes I've created within my digital Personal Knowledge Management systems.\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification|Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification]]\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean Code|Clean Code]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.

this means I passively generate content, and perhaps through integration, writing online could also feel as frictionless. \n- Both apps are written in native markdown content, making translation to web pages easy. \n- The value of each resource is substantial, but integrated, the resulting personal ecosystem could be way greater. \n\nI decided instead to stand on the shoulders of [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) 's incredible Quartz repo as the touchstone, and adapt my solution from there. \n\nIn the event it's useful for others, here are the steps I took to get it all going. \nIt involves: \n- [The Quartz Repository, by Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n- An existing [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/)\n\t- A particularly useful related plugin is [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint), for generating MOC pages. \n- [GitHub Pages for hosting](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n- And a little scripting for quality of life changes. \n---\n\n## Linux (ubuntu) installation:\n\nFirstly, fork and clone the following repo locally:\n\n````\nhttps://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n````\n\n### 1. Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n````\nsudo snap install hugo\n````\n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n   \n   * Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n   * [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n\n````\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n````\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n\ta. Confirm where GO installed itself (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\t\n\tb. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\t\n\tc. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\n   a. Get the modules required:\n   \n   ````\n   go get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   b. Install from repo:\n   \n   ````\n   go get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   c. Test with:\n   \n   ````\n   hugo-obsidian version\n   ````\n\n3. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n   \n   ````\n   make serve\n   ````\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n   \n   * I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n   * My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n   * All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n#### Automating export:\nHere's a quick and dirty bash script to clears the repo's copy of the vault and index files, to copy in the current ones from the obsidian vault location. \n\nAutomating this process means the creation process of posts is simple:\n1. Write/edit posts and index file as notes in obsidian\n2. Run `make serve` to host local render of website. \n3. Run script in terminal to update the browser render live. \n4. To post, push on git! \n\nFeel free to adapt if the idea is useful.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nSOURCE_PATH=~/path/to/source\nDESTINATION_PATH=~/path/to/destination\n\n# Delete all files in the target export folder - public_digital_garden is the folder that i've placed all my obsidian notes in (both in my vault and the quartz folder). Adapt for your folder name. \n\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden/*\nrm \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/_index.md\n\n# Copy index file and public folder from obsidian vault to export folder for git pushing\ncp -r \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/Public_Digital_Garden \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\ncp \"$SOURCE_PATH\"/_index.md \"$DESTINATION_PATH\"/\n```\n---\n#### References: \nResources:\n* https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/hosting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/troubleshooting/\n* https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/notes/config/\n* https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart\n* [Publishing your Vault Online With Quartz](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/) - [Brandon Boswell](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["obsidian","quartz"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Christopher-Nolans-Oppenheimer":{"title":"Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer","content":"\n- Super inspiring to be reminded of the incredibly impressive figures that spurred the [scientific revolution of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_in_science). \n\t- Reminded me of my fascination as a younger child, with inventors and their creations made through the magic of science and logic. \n- Very interesting to draw parallels in community and purpose of the science scene of then, and the start-up/tech culture of today. \n- Subtle parallels exist, such as:\n\t- Individuals creating for the sake of progress and personal ego, with little priority on the ethics and politics surrounding it -- a commonly voiced concern with AGI development. \n- Oppenheimer seemed an incredibly intelligent and accomplished visionary, who occupied a leadership/orchestrative enabled by his multi-faceted [expertise and interests](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4841924-isidore-i-rabi-a-close-friend-and-admirer-of-oppenheimer) -- somewhat similar to individuals like Steve Jobs. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["resonance-journal","Movie"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Dreams-without-goals-are-just-dreams-and-ultimately-they-fuel-disappointment":{"title":"\"Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment\"","content":"\n[YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LspuaSV_qII) \n\n\u003eDreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment.

In both instances, invest genuine interest and interaction while also trying to invest parts of the solution as you go. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["resonance-journal","youtube","learning"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Resonance-Journal":{"title":"Resonance Journal","content":"### A free-for-all list of all the content I consume that resonates with me. \n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer|Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment|Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Edsger Dijkstra’s One-Day Workweek|Edsger Dijkstra’s One-Day Workweek]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)|Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)]]\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Why Socrates Hated Democracy|Why Socrates Hated Democracy]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["MOC"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Why-Socrates-Hated-Democracy":{"title":"Why Socrates Hated Democracy","content":"\n[YouTube Link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJBzhcSWTk)\n\n- The Ship of State analogy, which argues the unreasonable nature of choosing a likeable, but unqualified individual to captain a ship responsible for dozens of other lives. \n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Socrates|Socrates]] believed that only those who had thought about issues rationally and deeply should be allowed to vote in matters of society. \n","lastmodified":"2023-08-12T08:51:32.491900969Z","tags":["resonance-journal","Philosophy"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Inspiration-Vault":{"title":"Inspiration Vault","content":"\n#### Inspiring figures:\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.

Primarily, use AI as a form of rubber duckying. This includes: \n    - Checking for correct syntax/syntax combinations.\n        - New syntax should always be understood, and tested with before implementing.\n    - Clarifying understanding of syntax, methods or other language features.\n        - ***********“is it correct to say…”***********\n    - Debugging issues, only after giving it at least a reasonable amount of time, in exhausting potential angles that can be theorised.\n\n2. Use it as an aid to explore and discover tools and libraries. \n\t- Though, the discovered item's native documentation should be scanned for context initially. \n\n3.
