But when we follow the suggestions of genetic and social instructions without question we relinquish the control of consciousness and become helpless playthings of impersonal forces. The person who cannot resist food or alcohol, or whose mind is constantly focused on sex, is not free to direct his or her psychic energy. ^ref-34014\n\nNote:\n\nThe value against natural impulses\n\n\n---\nPage: 29\n\nSubmission to genetic programming can become quite dangerous, because it leaves us helpless. A person who cannot override genetic instructions when necessary is always vulnerable. Instead of deciding how to act in terms of personal goals, he has to surrender to the things that his body has been programmed (or misprogrammed) to do. One must particularly achieve control over instinctual drives to achieve a healthy independence of society, for as long as we respond predictably to what feels good and what feels bad, it is easy for others to exploit our preferences for their own ends. ^ref-31231\n\nNote:\n\nBeing unable to act against what is comfortable and comes naturally, will lead to being at the whim of those forces, and not navigating to where one WANTS to go, but rather where their natural behaviour takes them.\nPersonal success however, is often built on doing what is uncomfortable, even if only at first.\n\n\n---\nPage: 27\n\nAs Freud and many others before and after him have noted, civilization is built on the repression of individual desires. It would be impossible to maintain any kind of social order, any complex division of labor, unless society’s members were forced to take on the habits and skills that the culture required, whether the individuals liked it or not. Socialization, or the transformation of a human organism into a person who functions successfully within a particular social system, cannot be avoided. The essence of socialization is to make people dependent on social controls, to have them respond predictably to rewards and punishments. And the most effective form of socialization is achieved when people identify so thoroughly with the social order that they no longer can imagine themselves breaking any of its rules. ^ref-45050\n\nNote:\n\nOn value of socialisation of populations\n\n\n---\nPage: 30\n\nThe solution is to gradually become free of societal rewards and learn how to substitute for them rewards that are under one’s own powers. ^ref-23837\n\nNote:\n\nBe internally motivated, to avoid external disruption to goals and manipulation .\n\n\n---\nPage: 37\n\nself-delusions—lies that an overly receptive mind tells itself. ^ref-14258\n\n---\nPage: 38\n\nWith ^ref-27581\n\n---\nPage: 28\n\nIt is important to realize that seeking pleasure is a reflex response built into our genes for the preservation of the species, not for the purpose of our own personal advantage. ^ref-4943\n\n---\nPage: 36\n\nOver the endless dark centuries of its evolution, the human nervous system has become so complex that it is now able to affect its own states, making it to a certain extent functionally independent of its genetic blueprint and of the objective environment. A person can make himself happy, or miserable, regardless of what is actually happening “outside,” just by changing the contents of consciousness. ^ref-24557\n\n---\nPage: 39\n\nWe may call intentions the force that keeps information in consciousness ordered. Intentions arise in consciousness whenever a person is aware of desiring something or wanting to accomplish something. Intentions are also bits of information, shaped either by biological needs or by internalized social goals. They act as magnetic fields, moving attention toward some objects and away from others, keeping our mind focused on some stimuli in preference to others. We often call the manifestation of intentionality by other names, such as instinct, need, drive, or desire. But these are all explanatory terms, telling us why people behave in certain ways. Intention is a more neutral and descriptive term; it doesn’t say why a person wants to do a certain thing, but simply states that he does. ^ref-23353\n\n---\nPage: 41\n\nIndividuals who depart from the norms—heroes, saints, sages, artists, and poets, as well as madmen and criminals—look for different things in life than most others do. The existence of people like these shows that consciousness can be ordered in terms of different goals and intentions. Each of us has this freedom to control our subjective reality. ^ref-58440\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Books/Four-Thousand-Weeks-Burkeman":{"title":"Four Thousand Weeks - Burkeman","content":"# Four Thousand Weeks - Oliver Burkeman\n# Notes:\n- Productivity is a trap.

Hall once pointed out, time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new tasks as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming “more productive” just seems to cause the belt to speed up. ^ref-33901\n\n---\nPage: 13\n\nProductivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster. Nobody in the history of humanity has ever achieved “work-life balance,” whatever that might be, and you certainly won’t get there by copying the “six things successful people do before 7:00 a.m.” The day will never arrive when you finally have everything under control—when the flood of emails has been contained; when your to-do lists have stopped getting longer; when you’re meeting all your obligations at work and in your home life; when nobody’s angry with you for missing a deadline or dropping the ball; and when the fully optimized person you’ve become can turn, at long last, to the things life is really supposed to be about. ^ref-34938\n\n---\nPage: 28\n\nNone of us can single-handedly overthrow a society dedicated to limitless productivity, distraction, and speed. But right here, right now, you can stop buying into the delusion that any of that is ever going to bring satisfaction. ^ref-43797\n\n---\nPage: 31\n\nThe reason isn’t that you haven’t yet discovered the right time management tricks or applied sufficient effort, or that you need to start getting up earlier, or that you’re generally useless. It’s that the underlying assumption is unwarranted: there’s no reason to believe you’ll ever feel “on top of things,” or make time for everything that matters, simply by getting more done. For a start, what “matters” is subjective, so you’ve no grounds for assuming that there will be time for everything that you, or your employer, or your culture happens to deem important. But the other exasperating issue is that if you succeed in fitting more in, you’ll find the goalposts start to shift: more things will begin to seem important, meaningful, or obligatory. ^ref-42767\n\n---\nPage: 32\n\n“Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion,” the English humorist and historian C. Northcote Parkinson wrote in 1955, coining what became known as Parkinson’s law. ^ref-60934\n\n---\nPage: 33\n\n(By contrast, negligent emailers frequently find that forgetting to reply ends up saving them time: people find alternative solutions to the problems they were nagging you to solve, or the looming crisis they were emailing about never materializes.) ^ref-44877\n\n---\nPage: 33\n\nSo it’s not simply that you never get through your email; it’s that the process of “getting through your email” actually generates more email. ^ref-28054\n\n---\nPage: 33\n\nAt the same time, you’ll become known as someone who responds promptly to email, so more people will consider it worth their while to message you to begin with. (By contrast, negligent emailers frequently find that forgetting to reply ends up saving them time: people find alternative solutions to the problems they were nagging you to solve, or the looming crisis they were emailing about never materializes.) So it’s not simply that you never get through your email; it’s that the process of “getting through your email” actually generates more email. ^ref-11209\n\n---\nPage: 40\n\nBut smoothness, it turns out, is a dubious virtue, since it’s often the unsmoothed textures of life that make it livable, helping nurture the relationships that are crucial for mental and physical health, and for the resilience of our communities. ^ref-33859\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Books/The-7-Habits-of-Highly-Effective-People-Covey":{"title":"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Covey","content":"# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People - Stephen R.

But shortly after World War 1 the basic view of success shifted from the Character Ethic to what we might call the Personality Ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. ^ref-18991\n\nNote:\n\nCharacter ethic vs Personality ethic\n\n\n---\nPage: 14\n\nMany people with secondary greatness—that is, social recognition for their talents—lack primary greatness or goodness in their character. ^ref-56956\n\n---\nPage: 18\n\nThe instructor was using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right.

No matter how hard you try at investing you won’t do well if you miss the two or three things that move the needle in your strategy. ^ref-12991\n\n---\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving-AWS-SA-Associate-SAA-C03-Certification":{"title":"Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification","content":"\n[View my badge!](https://www.credly.com/badges/c3452de8-7ff6-41a5-a3e4-0a88af63e75d/public_url)\n\n**Certified**: 11th Aug 2023. \n\n## Thoughts on Content:\nGenerally, all cloud service offerings are based on familiar, existing technologies that customers would normally have hosted themselves on-premises. \n\nDue to this, it was helpful to relate service offerings to general industry status quo and requirements. \nOther notes: \n\n- **Frame learning with a perspective of [[Digital-Cottage/Resonance Journal/Focusing Your Unconscious Mind - Learn Hard Concepts Intuitively (And Forever)|\"inventing\"]] the solutions.** I did this as I progressed through the content - linking it to tech I'm already familiar with, and other ones that I wasn't yet.\n\n- **Alternate between top-down and bottom up learning.** Lead this based on curiosity and naturally arising questions. Doing so would often walk me to \"ah-ha!\" moments. \n\n- **Make use of AWS directly to validate understanding.** Use the free tier! Also, consult AWS documentation as the single sources of truth. \n\n- **On a personal experience note,** It was  interesting to learn the concepts and relate it to the server hardware's design/architecture that I work with. \n\t- Internally, we use different code names for hardware to disassociate server from service (as well as tight controls on information), so my guess is as good as any but ...\n\t- It's fun to theorise on elements such as whether aurora storage is hosted on S3 or EBS based hardware. \n\n## Thoughts on the Exam:\nIt shouldn't be overlooked that the certification is contingent on displaying understanding in an exam scenario. Unavoidably, it's also important to cover exam-taking ability.\nGeneral priorities include: \n\n- **Familiarising with common *patterns* and *anti-patterns.*** *e.g*  Discerning between the ELB, DB and storage offerings for their respective use cases. \n\n- **Get comfortable with breaking down question structure efficiently.** I found it useful to read from the questions bottom up - I felt it allowed better identification of the important details, when reading through the fluff. \n\n### Napkin Scratch AWS Project ideas:\nWhile working through the content, I had fun letting my mind wander on potential uses for the services within future project ideas. \n\n- Use an S3 bucket with [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] to store backup/archives of either the user’s input spreadsheets, or output JSON files. \n\n- Include proof of concept (and probably overdesigned) elements of high availability, fault-tolerance and disaster recovery for web-app, just to better familiarise with the concepts.\n\n- Host an OOB error page with S3 static hosting and R53 DNS fail-over, for both [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]] and this [[_index|Digital Cottage website]]. \n\t- Potentially covered by free tier of AWS Shield Standard? \n\t\n- Experiment with various ways to break up the current monolithic design of projects to:\n\t- Dockerised containers. \n\t- Serverless architecture, running functions out of lambda. \n\n- Host webapp projects in \"self-healing\" auto-scaling groups, out of spot instances to ensure high availability. \n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["AWS","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Basic-Syntax-Refresher":{"title":"Bash Basic Syntax","content":"### Learning Resources: \nSkimming and pulling creating notes for TILs: \n- [Bash Scripting Tutorial for Beginners (FreeCodeCamp Video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK9Oc6AEnR4)\n- [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html)\n- https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_writing_shell_scripts.php\n\n--- \n### Hello World Scripting\nWhat is the line that all bash scripts need to start with, and why? \n?\nA shebang (`#!) declaration is required, so that the system knows what program/shell needs to be used in the running of the script. \n```\n#! /bin/bash\n```\n\nTo check version on debian/ubuntu/pop:\n```sh\nlsb_release -a\n```\n\nWhat permission change is required of bash script files to allow it's functionality? Explain the octal permission system and the common argument for sharing a script. \n?\nBash scripts need to have it's permission set to `executable` for the relevant principal executing. \nA common note, is to use `chmod 755` to only allow others read and execute permissions. \n```\nOctal base permissions:\n\n0 = None  \n1 = Execute  \n2 = Write  \n4 = Read\n\nThe rest are simply combinations of the base octals:\n\n3 is 1 + 2       // Execute and Write  \n5 is 1 + 4       // Execute and Read  \n6 is 2 + 4       // Write and Read  \n7 is 1 + 2 + 4   // Execute, Write, Readtip: if the number is odd, it includes Execute\n```\n\n### Variables and Conditional Arguments\n\nWhat syntax is used to receive user input to a variable? \n?\n`read`\ne.g\n```\necho First name?\nread FIRST_NAME\n\necho Last name?\nread LAST_NAME\n\necho Hello $FIRST_NAME $LAST_NAME\n```\n\nWhat are positional arguments and what is the `0`-th position reserved for?\n?\n- Refers to the arguments provided to shell, by commands. \n- The `0`-th argument is reserved for the shell.\n\nWhat is the syntax to make use of positional arguments?\n?\n`echo $1 $2` etc.\n```sh\n#! /bin/bash\n\necho Hello $1 $2\n```\n\n### Output Redirection\nHow do you redirect script output? \n?\nRedirects are done using \"`\u003e`\".\n\nWhat is the difference between CTRL + d and CTRL + c in interacting with terminal?\n?\n- CTRL + c  is an **interrupt**. \n- CTRL + d is a **End of File signal**, often this will log user out of terminal. \n\nWhat syntax allows appending text to an existing file, instead of overwriting it?\n?\n```\ncat B.txt \u003e\u003e A+B.txt\n```\n\n### Input Redirection\n\nWhat is a `heredocs`, what is it commonly used with and Why? \n?\n- `Heredocs` are multi-line command blocks. \n- Commonly used with `cat`. \n- This is as it allows for the printing of manipulated output/text to screen or to file by redirect. \n\nWhat is syntax for use of `Heredocs`?\n?\n- `Heredocs` use  (`\u003c\u003c`) syntax with a `DELIMITER`.\n- This has the effect of **redirecting input from a \"file\"** that users write into terminal, separated by lines and defined by the delimiters\n- Example: \n- Here, we are passing two lines of text containing an [environment variable](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-set-and-list-environment-variables-in-linux/) and a command to `cat` using a here document.\n```bash\n# The script will process everything between the delimiters (in this case EOF), as input to the command. \ncat \u003c\u003c EOF\nThe current working directory is: $PWD\nYou are logged in as: $(whoami)\nEOF\n```\n```output\nThe current working directory is: /home/linuxize\nYou are logged in as: linuxize\n```\n- or through use with \"`sort`\":\n```bash\ntommy@tommy-ubuntu-pc:~/Desktop$ sort -d \u003c\u003c EOF\n\u003e C\n\u003e B\n\u003e A\n\u003e EOF\n# output: \nA\nB\nC\n```\n\nWhat does `\u003c\u003c\u003c` syntax denote?\n?\n- These are  `herestrings`, similar to heredocs but instead placing the input to be redirected on the same line as the command. \n- `Herestrings` need to be within double-quotes:\n```\nwc -w \u003c\u003c\u003c \"Hello there wordcount!\" \n```\n```output\n# output: \n3\n```\n\nWhat are the different syntax methods to provide input to a command? \n? \n- Redirect `\u003c`\n- Heredocs `\u003c\u003c`\n- Herestrings `\u003c\u003c\u003c`\n\n### Comments\nWhat is the syntax for comments in bash? \n?\n```\n# Comments can be like this\n\n: ' \nor even\nlike\nthis\nfor blocks of text\n'\n\n```\n\n### Piping\nWhat is piping? What is it's syntax? \n?\nPiping is the practice of feeding the output of one command, into another. \n```\nls -l /bin/bin | grep bash\n```\nThis will only show ls results will hence only show results that contain the string \"bash\". \n### Test Operators\nWhat syntax refers to the exit code of the last command executed? How would you print this to terminal? \n?\n- Syntax to refer to last command's exit code / return value is  `$?`\n- We can print this to terminal with `echo $?`\n\nWhat is syntax to incorporate test/evaluation operators to a command? \n?\n- We can use square brackets e.g `[ hello = hello]`. \n\t- This would evaluate to the successful exit code `0`. \n\n### Conditionals and Test Expressions (if/elif/else)\nHow would you syntactically write an `if` comparison statement for a bash script, referencing the first provided argument to the command? \n? \nExample: \n```sh \n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ ${1,,} = herbert ]; then \n\techo \"asserted Herbert!\"\nelif [ ${1,,} = help ]; then\n\techo \"Enter your username!\" \nelse\n       echo \"Don't recognise user!\"\nfi\n\n# note: the commas simply denote to lowercase the variable through variable expansion. \n\n# the following showss\n```\n\nWhat is the equivalent to `len(x)` in bash?\n?\n- `${#x}`\n\nHow do you close `if` statements in bash? \n?\n`fi`. \n\nWhat is the syntax for **case statements**, noting start, end and new statement syntax. \n?\n```sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncase ${1,,} in\n\therbert | administrator)\n\t\techo \"Hello, you're the boss here!\"\n\t\t;;\n\thelp)\n\t\techo \"Just enter your username!\"\n\t\t;;\n\t*)\n\t\techo \"Hello there. You're not the boss of me. Enter a valid username!\"\nesac\n```\n\n### Arrays\nHow do you declare arrays in bash? \n?\n` MY_FIRST_ARRAY=(\"Apple\" \"Orange\" \"Banana\")`\n\nHow would you index into the first item in a bash array? How would you print the WHOLE array? \n?\n- Specific index:\n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[0]`\n- Entire array: \n\t`echo {MY_FIRST_ARRAY}[@]`\n\nHow do you add items to arrays in bash? What happens when you\n?\n- You place new values into unused indexes. \n\nHow do you remove items from arrays in bash?\n?\nYou use the `unset` command. \n```bash\n\nunset fruits[2]  # Deletes the element at index 2 (orange)\n```\n\nDoes bash support slicing?\n?\nYes - for example, you can get a range of elements using `${array[start_index:end_index]}`: \n```bash\nsome_fruits=(\"${fruits[@]:1:3}\")  # Copies elements from index 1 to 3\n```\n\n### Bash Functions\n\nWhat is bash syntax for defining and calling a function?\n?\n**Definition:**\n```bash\n# Define a function named \"greet\"\ngreet() {\n    echo \"Hello, welcome to Bash functions!\"\n}\n\n```\n**Example script calling function:**\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nhello_world() {\n   echo 'hello, world'\n}\n\nhello_world\n```\n\nHow can you pass arguments within script and from terminal, to functions?\n? \n- Arguments can only be received from the terminal (through `$1` etc.)\n\t- Bash does not support **function arguments**, like other languages. \nExample:\n```bash \n#!/bin/bash\n\n# Define a function that uses $1 (local argument)\nlocal_function() {\n    local local_arg=\"$1\"\n    echo \"Local argument: $local_arg\"\n}\n\n# Call the local_function\nlocal_function \"LocalArgValue\"\n\n# Use $1 (script argument)\necho \"Argument from terminal: $1\"\n\n---\ninput:\n./example.sh TerminalArgValue\n\noutput: \nLocal argument: LocalArgValue\nArgument from terminal: TerminalArgValue\n```\n- Note that this example is scoped within the same script, and doesn't take arguments from terminal. \n\n#### Parameter and expansion\nThe hash symbol `#` and the percent signs `\n\n1. `${variable#pattern}`\n    - When you use `${variable#pattern}`, it removes the shortest match of `pattern` from the beginning of the value stored in `variable`.\n\n2. `${variable\n    - When you use `${variable\n\nHere's a brief example to illustrate further:\n\n```sh\ntext=\"Hello, World!\" \n\necho ${text#Hello,}  # Outputs: \" World!\" \necho ${text%World!}  # Outputs: \"Hello, \"\n```\n#### Compressing a folder: \n```\ntar -czvf archive_name.tar.gz directory_name\n```\n- `-c`: Create a new archive.\n- `-z`: Compress the archive using gzip.\n- `-v`: Verbose mode, which displays the files being added to the archive.\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash-Programming":{"title":"Bash Programming","content":"\nRefreshing my knowledge, and building my own boilerplate cheatsheets: \n\n# Index: \n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Refresher|Bash Basic Syntax Refresher]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-grep|bash-grep]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find|bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-read|bash-read]] \n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["bash","linux"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean-Code":{"title":"Clean Code","content":"\nResource: [link](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["Programming","Learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Fitness-Dashboard-README":{"title":"Fitness Dashboard README","content":"\n\n# Fitness Dashboard\n## Video Demo:\nhttps://youtu.be/Np4lORlm-Y0\n\n## Concept: \nMy friends and I have been using the [FitNotes mobile app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.github.jamesgay.fitnotes\u0026hl=en_US) to recording our weightlifting training data for years now, but the app is mostly for personal use, and so the information is not easily shared or visible to each other.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Line graph visualisations of weight data trends over 3, 6 and 12 months. \n- Transforms Training Data to include weight data, and custom *Strength Index* scores. \n- Fully-featured tables that include sorting filters, to summarise the user's heaviest weight PRs, and highest *strength index* PRs as well as instant record searching. \n- Server-side saving of processed data and raw CSV submissions, as FitNotes has no fleshed out back-up function beyond exports. \n\nIn future, I plan to add more functions to supplement our fitness journeys, such as a TDEE calculator and a Bulk/Cut Diet Planning Calculator. \n\n## Directories:\nThe significant items in the root directory of the project are:\n##### app_core:\nThis folder contains blueprints and `.py` helper files that make up the majority of the processing logic of the project. \n\n`all_user_data`:\nser file submissions, and the subsequent processed file results are saved in separate folders here, split as per:\n- **training_data_submissions** (raw csv). \n- **weight_data_submissions** (raw csv). \n- **w_log_archive** (JSON strings).\n- **training_log_archive** (JSON strings).\n\t- Each raw CSV submission creates 3 different products of processed data, appended by the user's name. \n\t- These files are formatted to be expected input formats to utilised libraries  such as `tabulator` and `chart.js`. The functions will  search the directories for the most up-to-date file for that user, before loading it to the page. \n\t\t- e.g `All-Training-Data_Tommy_2024-02-06` \n\n`blueprints`:\nThis folder contains the 2 main submission processing logic `.py` files. The logic flow will be explained further down below. \n- `training_processing_bp.py`\n- `weight_processing_bp.py`\n\n##### flask_session: \nThis is from a flask module to enable the facilitating of user sessions, through client-side cookie interaction. \n\n##### static:\nThis directory contains the main `styles.css` file, as well as favicons for the site. \n\n##### templates:\nHere is contained all the HTML pages for the website, as accessible through the navbar. `layout.html` is the template which is used by the other pages, to extend the consistent elements to (navbar, JavaScript code linking etc). \n\n##### requirements.txt:\nThis is where all the modules were captured to, with `pip freeze`. \n\n\n\n## Logic/Implementation Explanation: \n### User Accounts Database: \n- User account/sign in data is stored within the `users.db` file, interacted with through an implementation of `SQLite` and `SQLAlchemy`.\n\t- Initially, the simplistic design of DB cursors was considered, but coding the literal string queries was not intuitive to read or maintain. \n\t- `SQLAlchemy` was implemented instead, which provides DB engine functionality, which improves efficiency by creating a single \"session\" for which the app can programatically engage when requiring database interaction, as opposed to create a cursor each time. \n\t- This is significantly more efficient, as the overhead to constantly creating and destroying cursor connections is eliminated. \n- Username strings's will be converted with `.lower()`, before being saved to `users.db`. \n- Passwords are **hashed**, before storing them in the DB -- this is done through the `werkzeug` module. \n\n### Shared Submission Functions:\n`validateCSV()`: \n- This is client-side functionality written as a HTML script. Data is validated to catch:\n\t- Empty CSV files/no file attached to form. \n\t- CSV files that do not adhere to the expected headers, as per the FitNotes app's export files. \n\t- Checking if the correct data field was selected, for the file type submitted (i.e not clicking weight data submission, with a weight data file). \n\n`/upload`:\n- This function is server-side, accessed through Flask's app routing mechanic (mapping URLs to functions), saving the file to the server to run validation functions it . \n- This function validates whether: \n\t- The submitted file is a `.csv`,`plaintext` or`.txt` file. \n\t- The filename is appended with the user's username. \n\t- Whether the column headers are within expected format, consistent with the FitNotes Export function. This is done through the `validate_CSV()` function in `helpers.py`. \n- If these conditions pass, then  `process_weight_log()` is called, and a success code/message is returned to the client on completion.\n- Otherwise, the file is cleaned up from the system with `os.remove()` and an error message is returned to the client, leaving no trace of the failed submission. \n\n### Weight Data Submission:\n\n#### Basic Logic Flow\n1. When the form in`checkin.html` is submitted with the `weight log` field, the `onsubmit=\"\"` function will first be called, to validate whether the user indeed attached a CSV file, and that it is not empty. \n\n2. If these conditions are present, then the form proceeds to make an asynchronous ajax call to the  `/upload` flask route, which runs further file validation functionality server-side.\n\t- If the file is as expected, then `process_weight_log()` will be called to produce the processed JSON data for site functions, using the input file. \n\n3. The client window will then wait to receive either a **success** or **error/failed** screen, to represent whether the submission is valid, uploaded and ready for viewing on the site; or whether it was invalid and subsequently disposed of. \n\n#### Functions: \n`/process_weight_log`: \n- First, the `select_latest_csv` helper function is called to parse the relevant directory to select the most recent submission (as per the timestamp included in filename, as FitNotes provides it), belonging to that user. \n\t- This avoids updating the user's statistics with older data, even if it's uploaded out of order. \n- The `pandas` module is then used to load the CSV file into a `dataframe`.\n\t- Irrelevant columns such as \"Time\" and \"Unit\" is dropped .\n\t- Each row's date and weight data is extracted as `key-value` pairs, saved as a `JSON string` data structure.\n\t- The filename is taken from the most recent weight entry, e.g `WeightLog_Tommy_2023-11-15`. \n- If this entire process succeeds without failure due to invalid fields, then a success code is returned, which then triggers the `upload` function to pass a success alert message to the client's browser. \n\n\n\n### Training Data Submissions:\n#### Basic Logic Flow:\nSimilar to weight submissions, the `process_training_log()` function is called as part of the submission form's `action`, after passing the basic `onsubmit()` empty file check. \n\n1. Each row is iterated over using  `panda`'s `.iterrows()` to first:\n\t- **Produce a dict containing all the training data** -- this is eventually saved as it's own `All-Training-Data-user-timestamp` JSON file.\n\t- All `NaN` datatypes due to empty fields are applied with the `N/A` string instead, for compatible representation with `tabulator`. \n\n2. If a **processed weight JSON** file is available for the user (found for user within `.../w_log_archive`) , it will also make use of that data to create *strength index values* (calling `calculate_SI()`) and append it to the dataframe.\n\t- This is a custom formula which takes into account the user's weight, and the rep range of the exercises set to develop a relative strength index score.\n\t- Weight records recorded within +/- 3 days of the date the exercises was executed are averaged to a single value, and then utilised for formula purposes. \n\t- The intention, is to allow users to compare strength feats, even if the context of data contains varying *reps*, *bodyweight* and *exercise weight*. \n\t- If no weight data is available, the `strength index` field for that row will be left blank. \n\t- The algorithim is a basic `O(n)`, `if x in y` test between all weight entries and all exercise entries. \n\n3. A second iteration is made over the `dict` created in step 1, now filtering/copying relevant records into two other `dicts`:\n\t- These are used to preload different table data on the dashboard. \n\t- Algorithm is also `O(n)`, though a single pass will be used to produce the required 2 output results. \n\t- Highest Weight PR dict:\n\t\t- Tracks the highest weight lifted, for each exercise. Substitutes heavier records during iterations to come to a single dict containing only the heaviest lifts of each exercise (Personal bests). \n\t- Strength Index PR dict:\n\t\t- Similar implementation as above, but instead tracks strength index scores. \n\n4. Each of these 3 data structures are then output and saved as JSON files, to be used by the dashboard elements:\n\tNamely:\n\t- `All-Training-Data_user_2024-02-06`\n\t- `Heaviest-PRs_user_2024-02-06`\n\t- `SI-PRs_user_2024-02-06`\n\n#### Functions: \n`calculate_SI`\nThe Strength Index (SI) is a custom formula designed to measure the strength feat of an exercise set, reagardless of fluctuating context (bodyweight, reps executed etc). \n* This weight value is the average of all available weight data, within a 7 day proximity window (3 days on either side + the date).\n* **Formula:** \n```py\n[ Reps x weight ] / [ bodyweight(kg) x RR Factor* ]\n```\n- RR factors:\n\n| Reps Range | Scaling Factor                                |\n| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |\n| 1-2 reps   | 3.3                                           |\n| 3-6 reps   | 1.4                                           |\n| 7-10 reps  | 1 (normal)                                    |\n| 11-15 reps | 0.8                                           |\n| 16+ reps   | None (don't calculate due to obvious skewing) |\n## Dashboard Explanation: \n### Modules: \n- **Chart.js:** JavaScript library used to create the line graph.\n- **Tabulator:** JavaScript library used to create interactive tables, storing the training data.\n### Data Flow: \n1. From the submission/processing functions, JSON files are ready on the server. \n2. This data is passed to the HTML template using `Jinja` templating.\n3. JavaScript is then used to substitute this data into the options for `tabulator` and `chart.js`\n\t- This allows for the client to load and switch between datasets dynamically without making server requests, after they fully load page the first time. \n\n### Elements: \n- **Weight Graph:** \n\t- Displays a line graph of the user's weight over different time periods (3 months, 6 months, 12 months).\n\t- Users can switch between these periods using buttons.  \n- **Sorted Training Data Tables:**\n\t- Shows the all the user's exercise records in an interactive table. Views can be switched to show:\n\t\t- User's heaviest weight PRs for each exercise;\n\t\t- User's highest *Strength Index* scoring lifts.\n\t- Users can switch between these two datasets using buttons.\n\t- Each row includes information including exercise name, reps, date achieved, body weight, and comments.\n- **All Training Data Table**:\n\t- Includes similar context information as mentioned above, but displays ALL their training data. \n\t- Still enjoys benefit of cross-referenced and appended weight data, to each lift record. \n\n\n\n## Other Design notes: \n### Metric System Measurement Support Only: \n- This decision to forgot Imperial measurements is heavily reliant on the target user being local friends who all use the **Metric System**. \n\t- With that said, in the fringe event someone is using the imperial system, they can change the setting in their app and upload again with records in metric system. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["Flask","Python","JavaScript"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Notes":{"title":"Notes","content":"### Free-for-all space for sharing notes I've created within my digital Personal Knowledge Management systems.\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification|Achieving AWS SA - Associate (SAA-C03) Certification]]\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Basic Syntax Refresher|Bash Basic Syntax Refresher]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Bash Programming|Bash Programming]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-awk|bash-awk]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-find|bash-find]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/bash-sed|bash-sed]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Clean Code|Clean Code]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Fitness Dashboard README|Fitness Dashboard README]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/pipenv|pipenv]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Notes/Robert J.

If you're using Python, you can install it using **`pip`** by running the following command in your system's command prompt or terminal:\n\n```\npip install virtualenv\n```\n\n## Step 2: Open VSCode.\nOpen Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your system.\n\n## Step 3: Open Terminal in VSCode:\nYou can do this by going to View \u003e Terminal or by using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+` (Backtick).\n\n## Step 4: Create a Virtual Environment In the terminal:\nNavigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment. \nNext, create a virtual environment by running the following command:\n\nFor Windows:\n\n```\npython -m venv env\n```\n\nFor macOS/Linux:\n\n```\npython3 -m venv env\n```\n\nThis will create a virtual environment named \"env\" in the current directory.\n\n## Step 5: Activate the Virtual Environment\nActivate the virtual environment by running the appropriate command based on your operating system:\n\nFor Windows:\n\n```\nenv\\\\Scripts\\\\activate\n```\n\nFor macOS/Linux:\n\n```bash\nsource venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n```\nsource venv/bin/activate\nor \nsource venv/scripts/activate\n```\n\nYou will notice that the virtual environment name \"env\" appears in the terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is now active.\n\n## Step 6: Start Using the Virtual Environment:\nMake sure you install any dependencies and modules you use in your project **only when the virtual environment is active**. \n\nAll installations will then be self-contained in that environment, allowed tidy bundling of dependencies, independent of the global server/OS configuration. \n\nHave it activated whenever you're working on the project! \n\n\n## Step 7: Deactivate the Virtual Environment:\nWhen you're done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running the following command:\n\n```\ndeactivate\n```\n\nThis will return your terminal to the default system environment/shell. \n\n**Remember to always activate the virtual environment before working on your project to ensure that you are using the correct dependencies and configurations for that specific project.**\n\n\n# Reproducing Environment On Other Systems:\nThis \nOn the local environment where your app works with all it's dependencies, run the following at the root directory:\n```sh\npip freeze \u003e requirements.txt\n```\nThis creates a file listing all the modules installed, as well as their versions. \n\nTo reliably set up those dependencies in other environments, first `clone` or have your project files wherever you want it to be. \nWhile in the directory with the `requirements.txt` file, install and activate the virtual environment, before running:\n```sh\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nThis will install all listed dependencies in the new environment. \n\n---\n### Resources\n- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-requirements-txt-file-in-python/\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":[]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Setting-Up-AWS-Sub-Account-Structure-For-Projects":{"title":"Setting Up AWS Sub-Account Structure For Projects","content":"\n\u003e[!note] \n\u003e AWS is shifting towards a system of IAM Identity Center (previously AWS SSO) federation and permission sets as recommended best practice, for setting up console/access keys. \n\u003e This provides temporary credentials for access for a role, instead of for IAM users. \n\u003e [Read more here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/sso-configure-profile-token.html). \n\n# Summary:\nWhen creating a new AWS account, there are several best practices that should be applied before you start building: \n1. Configure MFA. \n2. Create a new account, to retire the root account from admin usage. \n3. Create an organisation unit per project. \n4. Apply IAM users, roles and apply least-privilege principle to account access -- i.e create separate accounts for separate projects etc. \n5. If multiple accounts are created, make sure to utilise consolidated billing, and set-up SCPs to again apply least-privilege to accounts. \n6. Set up billing alarms for any used resources, especially if trying to stick to free tier. \n\nDoing this manually and without the assistance of tools such as Terraform, CDK, Control Tower etc. is tedious, so if you're looking to repeat the creation of these environments often, I would look into those tools. \n\n# Steps:\n## 1. Configure MFA\n**Root account:**\n1. Click on the account name on the top-left, then \"Security Credentials\". \n2. Under MFA, click \"Assign MFA Device\". \n3. Configure preferred MFA method.\n4. Sign out and Sign back in to verify. \n\n**Subsequent Users:**\n1. Head to the IAM Identity Center and enable the service with AWS Organisations. \n2. In the subsequent window, click on \"Configure multi-factor authentication (MFA)\".\n3. Review the settings before saving changes. Recommend to check:\n\t- \"*Require them to register an MFA device at sign in*\"\n4. Sign out of the account and sign back in to set-up MFA on root account. \n\n## 2. Create a new IAM User admin account\nCreate an admin account to perform administrator duties, aside from those that require the management account. After this account is made, **we mostly retire the management account**. \n\n**Creating Administrator Group:**\n1. In the **IAM Console**, click on Groups -\u003e Create Group on the left-hand panel. \n2. Assign a group name and check the box on the provided permission policy \"*AdministratorAccess*\" (should be the top most policy in that table). \n3. Click **Create Group** at the bottom. \n\n**Creating Administrative user**:\nThis is the account to use from now on, unless organisation changes need to be made. \n1. Staying in the **IAM Console** Click on **Users -\u003e Add User.**\n2. Set a username and password - good practice is to have that user set a new password on sign-in. Click next. \n3. Add that user to the previously created **administrator group**, and click next. \n4.  Review the configuration and create user. Make sure to save the provided URL here for signing in.\n5. Sign in using the link, and repeat setting up MFA. \n\n## 3. Creating an OU/sub-account for different projects\nIn essence, there should be a single management account serving to consolidate all sub-accounts. Under that, there will be a projects OU, with further sub-OUs to house each specific project, such as below: \n\n![](Digital-Cottage/Resonance%20Journal/attachments/AWS%20Projects%20Accounts.png)\n\n1. Navigate to AWS Organisations and click on **\"Add an AWS account**\". \n2. Create a new account filling in a separate email address\n\t- Tip: If you've got a gmail account, you can make use of their aliasing feature to utilise a single email for multiple user accounts. \n\t- e.g useremail@gmail.com can be used again with useremail+whateveryouwantsuffix@gmail.com. \n3. Open another incognito window and log into that newly created account, using the \"root account\" sign in options. \n4. ==Set-up MFA for this new project account!==\n5. Navigate back to AWS Organizations, and check on the \"**Root\"** folder. \n6. Click on the \"Actions\" button top-right, and create new organisational unit (I named mine \"projects\").\n7. Click on that newly created OU, and create another one with the specific project name, e.g above \"fitness-dashboard\". \n8. Add new AWS accounts to that specific project OU, following best practice of a Development and Prod account. \n\n## 4. Creating admin roles and worker roles for subsequent accounts:\nFor those newly created project specific accounts, we need to follow the same process of protecting the root AWS account, opting for an admin account instead. \n1. Follow step 2 within each of the DEV/PROD accounts, to create administrator IAM users. \n\t- Enable MFA!\n2. Create one extra IAM user for each of the accounts also, to represent the \"non-administrative worker\". \n\t- ==Don't attach this IAM user to the administrators group!==\n\t- e.g `fitness-dashboard-worker`. \n\n## 5. Creating IAM Roles for worker access to services\nBest practice is to only provide \"workers\" with the specific access they require, to do their job.\nThis is best applied through assigning access permissions to **IAM Roles**, based on the **IAM Group** the user belongs to. \nThere are many ways to do this, but here's a simple way using in-line policies (process is made through the admin account):\n\n1. Head to **IAM -\u003e Roles -\u003e Create Role**.\n2. Check box for \"Trusted Entity Type\", for **\"AWS Account**\", and \"Require MFA\".\n3. Select the required policies, such as \"*AmazonEC2FullAccess*\". \n4. Set a role name and create. \n5. Navigate to the worker user in **IAM -\u003e Users**. \n6. Click \"Add Permissions\" under the \"Permissions\" tab. \n7. Switch the view to `JSON` and add the ARNs to each of the new roles like so:\n\t- This allows the user to assume the specified roles. \n```json\n{\n\t\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",\n\t\"Statement\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"Sid\": \"Statement1\",\n\t\t\t\"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n\t\t\t\"Action\": \"sts:AssumeRole\",\n\t\t\t\"Resource\": [\n\t\t\t\t\"arn:aws:iam::[your_acc_no]:role/EC2-S3-full-access\",\n\t\t\t\t\"arn:aws:iam::[your_acc_no]:role/VPC_R53_fullaccess\"\n\t\t\t]\n\t\t}\n\t]\n}\n```\n\n8. Save changes! \n\t- Note the ARN lines down for next steps in enabling switching roles. \n\n### Switching Roles: \nThe worker user should have access to assume both roles now, and this can conveniently done through:\n1. In the top-right menu, and click  \"Switch Role\". \n2. Click \"Switch Role\" again. \n3. Enter the account number and, per it's inclusion in the ARN. \n4. Enter the role name under \"Role\". \n5. The display name and colour are up to your preference. \n6. Click switch role. Switched roles will be shown in the top-right menu for future convenience. \n![](Digital-Cottage/Resonance%20Journal/attachments/Setting%20up%20AWS%20sub-account%20structure%20for%20projects.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n##### Resources: \n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/mfa-configure.html\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-up.html\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVJnenaD3U8\n- https://mim-armand.medium.com/steps-to-create-an-aws-sub-accounts-free-tier-2268b17c9f7\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_tutorials_basic.html\n- https://dev.to/aws-heroes/setting-up-a-multi-account-aws-environment-1h67\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/109776f/how_should_individual_developers_access_devprod/\n- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfE2G-fsBNU \n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.815362362Z","tags":["AWS"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Notes/Setting-up-SSH-to-EC2-Instances":{"title":"Setting up SSH to EC2 Instances","content":"\n# For existing/running instances:\n1.

The users who I would be sharing this to, and who would actually use it can be counted on one hand. \n\n**Action:**\n- Implement cloudwatch alarms that track resource utilisations. \n- Set a reminder to swap from T3.Micro to a spot instance after close to a year lol. \n#### Potential Attacks / Exploitation:\nI've designed the app to be relatively stateless; this means all user data can be quickly produced anytime they submit their Fitnotes file (no functionality for changes to data server side -- all changes should be made within the app). \n\n**Action:**\n- If ever choosing to implement real data such as emails etc, utilise better controls such as RDS instead of the SQLite db. \n- Don't implement any form of user *download* functionality, just in case it's ever compromised. Keep the project as a way to receive and represent user given data.  \n- I don't think it's worth justifying paying for **NAT Gateways** or **NLBs** yet, so I'll do the less tasteful decision to host my EC2 instance in a public subnet for now. \n\t- In future, once I've got more apps to show I can obsfucate them all behind a single NLB -- especially when security is a higher concern. Currently though, **there's no real user data to be compromised**\n\t- Something like the following... \n\t\t![[Digital-Cottage/Projects/attachments/aws.drawio.png]]\n#### Considering Serverless:\nA serverless design with Lambda was considered, but current app design makes use of session data for users functionality. Also, cold starts to lambda might make the experience lacklustre. \n# V3: \n⬜ Integrate the app's CI with gitlab pipeline, so further updates will build to the live site. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.819362378Z","tags":["Flask","Python","HTML","CSS"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Projects/Projects":{"title":"Projects","content":"### Napkin sketches, working products, and everything in between. \n\n\n\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Fitness Dashboard|Fitness Dashboard]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Projects/Setting Up An Obsidian-based Digital Cottage Website|Setting Up An Obsidian-based Digital Cottage Website]]\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.819362378Z","tags":["MOC"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Projects/Setting-Up-An-Obsidian-based-Digital-Cottage-Website":{"title":"Setting Up An Obsidian-based Digital Garden Website","content":"\nIt's been a backlog priority of mine for a while now to start writing online. \nAs someone who has been working with a second brain/PKM system for a while now (Notion \u0026 Obsidian), I figured a solution that can leverage that personal written content for the purpose would be ideal: \n\n- Note-taking is part of my natural way of working - this means I passively generate content, and perhaps through integration, writing online could also feel as frictionless. \n- Both apps are written in native markdown content, making translation to web pages easy. \n- The value of each resource is substantial, but integrated, the resulting personal ecosystem could be way greater. \n\nI decided instead to stand on the shoulders of [jackyzha0](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) 's incredible Quartz repo as the touchstone, and adapt my solution from there. \n\nIn the event it's useful for others, here are the steps I took to get it all going. \nIt involves: \n- [The Quartz Repository, by Jacky Zhao](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)\n- An existing [Obsidian Vault](https://obsidian.md/)\n\t- A particularly useful related plugin is [Waypoint](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Waypoint), for generating MOC pages. \n- [GitHub Pages for hosting](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)\n- And a little scripting for quality of life changes. \n---\n\n## Linux (ubuntu) installation:\n\nFirstly, fork and clone the following repo locally:\n\n````\nhttps://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz\n````\n\n### 1. Install Hugo:\n\nQuartz runs on top of Hugo, so we'll need to independently install it. For me, this was on linux, but hugo has documentation for installation on other OS's too.\n\n````\nsudo snap install hugo\n````\n\n### 2. Install `Hugo-obsidian` + Go dependencies, if required:\n\n1. Install go if not already installed on system.\n   \n   * Make sure go version is (\u003e= 1.16).\n   * [Go installation page](https://gohugo.io/installation/)\n2. Initialise a new go module for project, using github repo URL. e.g\n\n````\ngo mod init github.com/Blamechance/blamechance.github.io\n````\n\nIf you experience path issues, indicated by `command not found` errors:\n\n\ta. Confirm where GO installed itself (normally in `~/[user]` folder).\n\t\n\tb. Edit or create `.bash_profile` file in user directory.\n\t\n\tc. Add the following line to the file, e.g:\n\n```\nexport PATH=\"$HOME/go/bin:$PATH\"\n```\n\nRun the following to load the edited config to current shell (you might need to restart your app if operating terminal in something like vscode for same effect):\n`source ~/.bash_profile`\n\n3. Install `hugo-obsidian` to enable backlink conversion, for local site live previewing:\n\n   a. Get the modules required:\n   \n   ````\n   go get github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   b. Install from repo:\n   \n   ````\n   go get go install github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian\n   ````\n   \n   c. Test with:\n   \n   ````\n   hugo-obsidian version\n   ````\n\n3. To run, navigate to the folder where quartz was cloned and run:\n   \n   ````\n   make serve\n   ````\n\n### 3. Copy obsidian/markdown files to quartz\n\n1. Navigate to the desired obsidian folder to upload.\n   \n   * I set up my vault to have a `public` and a `private` folder. \n   * My workflow for now will involve working in obsidian, and logically considering the `public` folder the space where I move notes I want to share. \n   * All notes/posts will be edited and created through the obsidian -\u003e export process, with the only elements needing editing within an IDE being the index file, CSS, html etc. \n2. Copy the folder into the `content` folder in your quartz directory.\n\n3. That's it! Run `make serve` to view your website locally, and push to your github repo to host it on [Github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart).\n\n#### Automating export:\nHere's a quick and dirty bash script to clears the repo's copy of the vault and index files, to copy in the current ones from the obsidian vault location. \n\nAutomating this process means the creation process of posts is simple:\n1. Write/edit posts and index file as notes in obsidian\n2. Run `make serve` to host local render of website. \n3. Run script in terminal to update the browser render live. \n4. To post, push on git! \n\nFeel free to adapt if the idea is useful.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n\nSOURCE_PATH=~/path/to/source\nDESTINATION_PATH=~/path/to/destination\n\n# Delete all files in the target export folder - public_digital_garden is the folder that i've placed all my obsidian notes in (both in my vault and the quartz folder).

This will lead to a sense of progress. \n- Create sub-goals along a map, as this allows you to track progress tangibly. \n- Shrink goals as small as possible, as the smaller the units of work, the better you can track it.\n- This way, each small task unit can simulate the \"step-after-step\" or \"rep-after-rep\" mentalities echoed by runners and Arnold Schwarzenegger respectively.\n\n**Motion builds momentum -- utilise small victories, even if simple, to lubricate the motion towards the larger ones:**\n- Author example: \n\tSetting a timer for 60 seconds, to push self to write any amount of words, towards a longer writing goal. \n*My own anecdotes:*\n- Solving easy coding problems, to lubricate the logic muscles and reduce friction to coding sessions/tackling harder problems or projects.\n- Short gym workouts, to ease into larger ones. \n- Short \"just get out the house\" cardio sessions, that turn themselves into twice a week longer ones. \n\n**The paralysis of perfectionism:**\n- Perfectionism signals flaws and failure to your own feedback systems -- this kills motivation, and stifles productivity. \n- The quality of user-generated output, is potentially only accessible by first \"pouring out the bad stuff\", and getting past the low quality generation of content. \n- Are my ambitious goal setting methods, with tight personal deadlines (shoot for the moon and reach the stars method) not conducive to overall productivity due to this effect? \n\n**The lack of dialogue over shared stuckness:**\n- Social media is particularly terrible for this - as there are no highlighting of stuckness and slowness, despite it being a natural phenomena to progress. \n- This \"pluralistic ignorance\" is amplified as only successes are shared, from a network of people, in a way that it is consistently visible, implying a normalcy that is false. \n- Breakdown the pluralistic ignorance, by breaking the silos between people, and opening dialogue between the frictions, stuckpoints and obstacles!\n\n**A long journey is rarely a linear path:**\n- Success is not often through a single golden ticket route -- by this strict binary definition, success would seldom happen. \n\t- Define success through a **system**, bring the locus of control internal -- and measure success by elements in which you have control.\n\t- e.g Time spent coding, problems solved, projects created etc. \n\n**Quantity is a unavoidable precursor to quality**:\n- You NEED the misses, to have successes in aggregate. \n- Try multiple approaches, and try different things, in order to find the right path. \n\n**Steady practice evolving into a sense of no progression - plateaus**:\n- Habituation could lead to this effect -- you gain expertise to the routine and system, as opposed to reacting to the target challenges. \n- Comfort, provided from doing the same thing over and over again, turns into complacency that leads to stagnation. \n\n**Find what really matters -- every topic contains an overwhelming volume of information**\n- Learn to strip away and set artificial constraints on input data, as to develop effective comprehension and productivity. \n\n**Negative Stereotype Effect:**\n- Awareness that you belong to a group that have a stereotype of being poor within that community, it CREATES the effect of increased metal stuckness and low morale. \n\t- Do not let the stereotype effect define your potential -- recognise it, maybe, as a challenge, but not a defining characteristic. \n\n**Action above all**\n- Being stuck is about being in one place, but wanting to be somewhere else. \n- Ultimately, the thing you have to do the most, is **ACT** and move towards that direction. \n- In the act of doing, you show to yourself inserts change and potential -- whereas sitting still and thinking, simply does nothing but perpetuates the current situation. \n\n**Hitting the button to shuffle the letters**\n- Sometimes, you just need a different perspective to things. \n\n**Having, and achieving any goal, even if unrelated to the main muse, provides movement that can aid unstucking**:\n- It allows your mind to realise, you are NOT stuck. \n# Takeways:\n## Strategies against stuckness: \n\n**Be aware of the \"U-shape\" trap to feelings of progress.**\n- The middle of the journey will be the most difficult, and also where the majority of these strategies can be applied. \n\n**Break up and shrink goals and tasks to be as granular as possible. This provides an effective way to track and sense progress.** \n- Create a map towards goals, comprised of these granular tasks as it's units. This allows a visualisation of total progress, expressed in granular, seemingly unimportant completions. \n\n**Never aim for perfection.** \n- Perfectionism is a detriment to all systems. It provides only compounding negative feedback, as anything that is not perfect, is a failure. \n- Utilise small victories, no matter how novel or even unrelated, to build movement. \n- Be aware of the requirement to **leverage quantity, to find quality** (pouring the bad out first). \n- Action, no matter how unsure the direction, is often better than to sit and wondering will maintain cirucmstances -- It provides the circumstance exposure to **potential**. \n\n**Fight against habituation, which ultimately, leads to stagnation.** \n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.819362378Z","tags":["resonance-journal","podcast","psychology"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Resonance-Journal/Human-Ingenuity-and-Beating-Tetris":{"title":" After 34 Years Someone Finally Beat Tetris - aGameScout","content":"[Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ5UuknsHU).\n\nThe evolution of the Tetris Meta is a great example for humanity's tenacity for continuous improvement.

In an effort to bring the spirit of \"*[essentialism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDBYci4Vy2k)*\" to my productivity and organisation systems, I decided to experiment with physical journaling. \n\nI took [inspiration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPnvN6PyLg) from a few [content creators](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8vwGLMTx5I) and came upon the following additions to my daily workflows. \n# The 3 Methods Of Journaling: \n## Morning Pages:\n\nMorning pages is a concept popular initially amongst creatives, that suggests starting the day with 2 or 3 pages pages of lawless physical writing. It's less of a journal, and more of a unfiltered, written stream of consciousness. \n\nI've found the slowness and intentional nature of physical writing to pull at the loose mental threads that make up a hectic mind. It tests the validity of each floating thought, checking whether they're just small nonsensical thoughts without merit or substance.\n\n- If that is the case, then the thoughts won't make pass the slow and intentional filters of physical writing, as it fails to be articulated, and hence filter itself away as unimportant *mental noise*. \n\n- Otherwise, if these threads are found to be *significant and notable* thoughts, then the same filters will  prevent the unintelligibly crowding of thoughts (*pronounced over-thinking*), instead articulating only your most logical thoughts through writing. \n- These can lead to real insights, which I then note into my \"daily\" journal. \n![mental-noise.png](Digital-Cottage/Thoughts%20And%20Mental%20Snippets/attachments/mental-noise.png)\n\nThe result is that morning pages will often **only reveal what is substantial, relevant and worth noting.** Mental noise is instead replaced with an assurance that any thought that might've attracted your attention, is surely irrelevant, hence removing it's power from pulling you into infinite directions. \n\nAnother benefit I've noticed, is that ==the uninterrupted writing leads to a **no-stakes launchpad effect into a state of deep work**==. Since the output is not real work that priorities are reliant on, it allows the momentum built from simply doing the action to be carried over into work done directly after the routine. \n\n## Goal-setting Journal: \nThis journal is an analogue way to track my quarterly goals.\n\n![muji-notebook](Digital-Cottage/Thoughts%20And%20Mental%20Snippets/attachments/muji-notebook.jpg)\n\nEach goal is broken down into multiple **checkpoint tasks** which represent progress towards the target. These checkpoint tasks serve to measure progress towards the goal, as well as action items that can be referenced and pulled into Today's Action Items at any one time. \n\nEvery morning, I'll refer to open checkpoint tasks knowing they are representative of my quarterly priorities, and bring in 2-3 to be the focus for completion in the day's priorities. \n\n*Here's the base idea, as per how [Maurice does it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inPnvN6PyLg):*\n![check-point-tasks](Digital-Cottage/Thoughts%20And%20Mental%20Snippets/attachments/65c1790781c351547eeeacc3.png)\n\nThese 2-3 targets will then be slot into a rough daily schedule for how my day will go. Once this is complete, I can import the tasks into Ticktick to be tracked in my digital tools over the day. \n\n## Mindfulness Journal (Daily Journaling): \nThis one's kind of cheating as it's typed, and saved within an obsidian vault. Though I find it benefits from the quickness that comes with typing, without too much chaotic noise, as it's focused with a bunch of \"*prompts*\". \n\nThis journal serves to keep me more accountable and mindful to my life and it's events. It's filled with prompts that force me to think about and process daily events properly. The majority of the time it's in a bullet journal guided by prompts, though on days where I need a space to record certain events/thoughts or simply work through them, there's space for that too. \n\nAt the end of the week, I'll go through each daily journal and review the week in a weekly journal as well, with it's own prompts. \n\n# Remarks\nAlthough digital tools provide a much quicker way to get thoughts down, this quickness is often at the cost of intention and substance.\n\nBy starting with analogue planning, and migrating those plans to our digital tools, I feel there's a great case for a well-rounded, balanced organisation system that makes use of our tools more intentionally; rather than succumbing to transcribing all mental noise as quick as possible to our tools, simply because we can.  \n\n## Templates\nThe weekly journal allows a glance of the week, and a reflection space to see how I can improve and set next week up for success. \n\nIf you use the periodic notes/calendar plug-in, you can set-up these templates to generate on clicking dates. I've set-up a separate vault for this, and it's been very effective so far. \n\nHere's the markdown templates I use,  in case it's useful to you:\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Daily Journal Template 2024|Daily Journal Template 2024]]\n- [[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Weekly Journal Template 2024|Weekly Journal Template 2024]]\n\n### Related: \n- There's a quote in [[Digital-Cottage/Books/The Psychology of Money - Housel|The Psychology of Money - Housel]] that speaks of a similar anecdote of \"pouring out the bad\" with a workflow similar to morning pages; but for writing songs. It refers to getting rid of the waste product that precedes the high value output. \n\t- [[Digital-Cottage/Thoughts And Mental Snippets/Pareto Principle|Pareto Principle]] \n- In the book [[Digital-Cottage/Books/Four Thousand Weeks - Burkeman|Four Thousand Weeks - Burkeman]], a compelling case against the \"efficiency trap\" of the modern day. It argues that the modern society stance on productivity is a trap which instead, leads us to be less effective than ever. \n\n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.823362394Z","tags":["Journaling"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Coding-without-expectations-vs.-intentional-intensity":{"title":"Coding without expectations vs. intentional intensity","content":"\nIn my learning journey, I'm noticing there's two schools of thought to approaching the prerequisite \"10,000 hours of mastery\". \n\n### Callous your mind and work with intensity, and predetermined targets \n- This approach focuses primarily on one's tenacity and effort. \n- It adheres to the deep work formula proposed by Cal Newport in his work \"Deep Work\"\n\t- *High-Quality Work Produced = Time Spent * Intensity of Focus*\n\t- A mentioned anecdote from the book is Theodore Roosevelt's multi-achievements at relatively young ages. It explores how it was likely made possible, through peer accounts of how he would be working on several things simultaneously, in bursts of intense deep work sessions. \n- David Goggins often proposes the concept of \"callousing your mind\", asserting that individuals need to be intentionally exposed to friction and discomfort; and in doing so, would develop the toughness to increase capacity to create value. \n\nThough I have had many productive results from approaching work sessions with this perspective (CS50!), the uncompromising standard for input intensity and result output can also set things up for failure. Specifically, consistently not meeting targets can have an accumulative demoralising effect; whether due to a persistent bug, mental/focus blocks, or simply poor estimation of the task at hand. \n\nThis is accumulative effect is compounding, and creates a negative feedback loop -- which arguably makes for an ineffective system by design. \n\n### Coding/working without expectations\nThis concept was first introduced to me by [YouTuber BigBoxSWE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0eB7tMkvs4\u0026t=16s). During a time when I was banging my head against a bash script, stubbornly telling myself I needed to finish it yet severely underestimating the scope, it ended up spilling over multiple days, into weeks. It opened up my perspective to the value in having a flexible approach. \n\nIt made learning, practice and the general pursuit towards my learning goals demotivating, and lead to way more friction to just get seated and to start. \n\nIn this instance, I took the advice and decided to spend some time doing CodeWar problems. Each solved problem provided a nice dopamine boost, and gave me the confidence to throw myself back into the head-banging stuff. \n\nThough, there's likely a trap in here that could lead oneself into \"feeling productive\" without actually creating meaningful, high-quality value output -- to this point, this (and the former) approach would only generate it's most effective value when used within an en effective, alternating strategy guided by intuitive feeling. \n\n### Ultimately... \nThe critical thing is likely that **you keep going, and do so consistently**. The best application of these two schools of thoughts is likely to use both interchangeably, based on factors such as time/stamina/focus available -- mentally, you won't be in a single static frame of mind along the journey after all, and will have moments where you're more motivated or available than others. \n\n\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.823362394Z","tags":["Productivity"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Daily-Journal-Template-2024":{"title":"Daily Journal Template 2024","content":"```markdown\n# Daily Journal - {{date: dddd, DD MMM YYYY}}\n\n\u003e[!quote]  \n\u003e I created a mission statement here after reading The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.

It helps to get it done.**\n- Quick sketches or prototypes can make production and final drafts. \n\n\u003e \t\"*I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu).\"*\n\u003e \t- **Linus Torvalds**, at age 21, changing the world. \n\t\n**3. There is no editing stage.**\n- If you make a mistake, start again.\n\t\n**4. Pretending you know what you’re doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you’re doing even if you don’t and do it.**\n- Learning is a continuous process, so in doing, you know what you are doing. \n\n\n**5. Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.**\n- Creativity and inspiration comes in sporadic waves. \n- A good idea should not be procrastinated on. If it is, then it should be abandoned for another. \n\t\n**6. The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.**\n- In moving onto the next one, you are one project richer and one step closer to your goal. \n\t\n**7.

It’s boring and keeps you from being done. ==**\n\t\n**9. People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.**\n- Don't allow people with uneducated perspectives to sway your beliefs. \n- Rather, place more value on the input of those who are where you want to be, or have done what you want to achieve. \n- Particularly so, if they have proven experience in repeating this success, and guiding others to this exact success. \n\t\n**10. Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.**\n- Failure is proof of an effortful attempt. Success, comparatively, teaches us very little. \n- Would you follow the advice of someone who had failed various ways before finding success, or someone who won the metaphorical lottery and stumbled to their position? \n\n**11. Destruction is a variant of done.**\n- Many forms of success are predicated on experimentation. \n- These stepping stones used to gain experience, yet tossed as to not \"edit\" it into stifling stagnation.

Primarily, use AI as a form of rubber duckying. This includes: \n    - Checking for correct syntax/syntax combinations.\n        - New syntax should always be understood, and tested with before implementing.\n    - Clarifying understanding of syntax, methods or other language features.\n        - ***********“is it correct to say…”***********\n    - Debugging issues, only after giving it at least a reasonable amount of time, in exhausting potential angles that can be theorised.\n\n2. Use it as an aid to explore and discover tools and libraries. \n\t- Though, the discovered item's native documentation should be scanned for context initially. \n\n3. If all possible branches of possibilities to tackling debugging are exhausted, use AI to minimise time wasted slamming head into keyboard. \n\t- Had many days of frustration lost over simple debugs -- I'm opting to consider this as equivalent value to having a mentor, in the interest of accelerating productivity. \n\n---\n\n### Useful Tools:\n\n- Youtube video summarising tools:\n    \n    - [summarize.tech](https://www.summarize.tech/)\n    \n    - [Glasp](https://glasp.co/youtube-summary)\n    \n- GPT3.5 Agent\n    - [AgentGPT 🤖](https://agentgpt.reworkd.ai/)\n","lastmodified":"2024-02-29T02:30:17.823362394Z","tags":["AI","learning-journal"]},"/Digital-Cottage/Thoughts-And-Mental-Snippets/Shit-rentals-and-the-value-of-a-social-media-following":{"title":"Shit rentals and the value of a social media following","content":"A friend shared an article recently that detailed how \"Tiktoker\" Jodie van den Berg, had launched a database website that allowed previous renters of \"shit rentals\" to share their experience for future tenants. \n[*Article here*](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-10-01/tiktoker-launches-renters-property-database-thedrum/102922346)\n\nIt's not an overly complicated implementation -- making use of a third party (AirTables) DBaaS while and fields for people to populate.
