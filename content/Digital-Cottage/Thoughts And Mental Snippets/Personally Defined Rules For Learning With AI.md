Fundamentally, AI should be used as a first-point substitution for scanning of documentation, rubber ducky-ing as well as a tool to reduce start-up friction to tasks  ‚Äî but rarely as a tool for bridging gaps in logic ability.

>[!danger]
>Any new information provided by AI should be understood and learned before utilising ‚Äî NEVER implement code or logic you do not understand. 

1. Primarily, use AI as a form of rubber duckying. This includes: 
    - Checking for correct syntax/syntax combinations.
        - New syntax should always be understood, and tested with before implementing.
    - Clarifying understanding of syntax, methods or other language features.
        - ***********‚Äúis it correct to say‚Ä¶‚Äù***********
    - Debugging issues, only after giving it at least a reasonable amount of time, in exhausting potential angles that can be theorised.

2. Use it as an aid to explore and discover tools and libraries. 
	- Though, the discovered item's native documentation should be scanned for context initially. 

3. If all possible branches of possibilities to tackling debugging are exhausted, use AI to minimise time wasted slamming head into keyboard. 
	- Had many days of frustration lost over simple debugs -- I'm opting to consider this as equivalent value to having a mentor, in the interest of accelerating productivity.
