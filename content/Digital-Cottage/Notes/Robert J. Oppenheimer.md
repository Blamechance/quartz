A brilliant and highly influential physicist who held a cross-sectional view on life. 
He was esteemed within the scientific community for his achievements in theoretical physics, but is most-well known for orchestrating a mammoth directive effort to achieve the creation of the first atomic bomb in history. 

He experienced immense guilt from this achievement, and spent the following years of his life acting to take responsibility through advocating against further weapons of mass destruction development, such as with the hydrogen bomb. 

He was the victim of McCarthyism, but the scientific community seem to have largely taken his side. During his trial, [the](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis_Strauss) [individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Teller) that spoke out against his character, were ostracised and faced backlash destroying their reputations.
