### Death of Socrates: 

Socrates was brought to [trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Socrates) for impety, despite lack of evidence. 
This was likely orchestrated by his political rivals. 

Despite this, following his personal set of principals and philosophical ideas that he would often speak to, would obey the state's judgement unto him. 

I hold admiration for the authenticity and strength of character that enabled him to maintain his principals and conviction, even in spite of the projected outcome.

> In the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, an action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens (see: _[Crito](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crito "Crito")_).

> Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death sentence and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial.
