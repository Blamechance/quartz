### Personality ethic vs. Character Ethic 
Covey presents the following views that focus present the idea that *Personality Ethic* is inherently less valuable:

Character Ethic **focuses on foundational traits, including integrity, humility, hard work, loyalty, self-control, courage, justice, patience, modesty, and morality**.
- Character ethic depends on deep changes within each of us, while the personality ethic falls back on methods or techniques. 

Personality Ethic emphasizes **skills and practices** (techniques) that affect your *public image, attitudes, and behaviours*. 
- The personality ethic does not challenge us; neither does it bring about deep changes within us. 

He reasons that *personality ethic* has it's own value, but value which is only supplementary to that which is generated by true, fundamental changes brought about by **character ethic**.
