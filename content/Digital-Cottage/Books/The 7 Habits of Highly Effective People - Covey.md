The Character Ethic taught that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character. But shortly after World War 1 the basic view of success shifted from the Character Ethic to what we might call the Personality Ethic. Success became more a function of personality, of public image, of attitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. ^ref-18991

Note:

Character ethic vs Personality ethic

Many people with secondary greatness—that is, social recognition for their talents—lack primary greatness or goodness in their character. ^ref-56956

The instructor was using it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right. It’s not logical; its psychological. ^ref-45866

We see the world, not as it is, but as we are—or, as we are conditioned to see it. ^ref-10478

Page: 28

The glitter of the Personality Ethic, the massive appeal, is that there is some quick and easy way to achieve quality of life—personal effectiveness and rich, deep relationships with other people—without going through the natural process of work and growth that makes it possible. It’s symbol without substance. It’s the “get rich quick” scheme promising “wealth without work.” And it might even appear to succeed—but the schemer remains. ^ref-53510

In an attempt to compensate for my deficiency, I borrowed strength from my position and authority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do. ^ref-15196

Page: 33

My experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach. When relationships are strained and the air charged with emotion, an attempt to teach is often perceived as a form of judgment and rejection. ^ref-6025

is there a chance that efficiency is not the answer? Is getting more things done in less time going to make a difference—or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances that seem to control my life? ^ref-58988

“The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them.” ^ref-32970

Page: 44

Independent thinking alone is not suited to interdependent reality. Independent people who do not have the maturity to think and act interdependently may be good individual producers, but they won’t be good leaders or team players. They’re not coming from the paradigm of interdependence necessary to succeed in marriage, family, or organizational reality. Life is, by nature, highly interdependent. ^ref-18180

Private victories precede public victories. ^ref-57536

Our most important financial asset is our own capacity to earn. If we don’t continually invest in improving our own PC, we severely limit our options. We’re locked into our present situation, running scared of our corporation or our boss’s opinion of us, economically dependent and defensive. ^ref-40208

Thoughts on highlight:

Build a skillset that is independent of specific orgs


---
Page: 53

Too much focus on PC is like a person who runs three or four hours a day, bragging about the extra ten years of life it creates, unaware he’s spending them running. ^ref-56608

Thoughts on highlight:

Don't eternally work to generate value and golden eggs for others -- reap P for yourself, for all the PC being put in!


---
Page: 53

Or a person endlessly going to school, never producing, living on other people’s golden eggs—the eternal student syndrome. ^ref-46881

“That’s me. That’s just the way I am.” I am determined. There’s nothing I can do about it. “He makes me so mad!” I’m not responsible. My emotional life is governed by something outside my control. “I can’t do that. I just don’t have the time.” Something outside me—limited time—is controlling me. “If only my wife were more patient.” Someone else’s behavior is limiting my effectiveness. “I have to do it.” Circumstances or other people are forcing me to do what I do. I’m not free to choose my own actions. ^ref-30600

Page: 70

The language of reactive people absolves them of responsibility. “That’s me. That’s just the way I am.” I am determined. There’s nothing I can do about it. “He makes me so mad!” I’m not responsible. My emotional life is governed by something outside my control. “I can’t do that. I just don’t have the time.” Something outside me—limited time—is controlling me. “If only my wife were more patient.” Someone else’s behavior is limiting my effectiveness. “I have to do it.” Circumstances or other people are forcing me to do what I do. I’m not free to choose my own actions. ^ref-39939

“My friend, love is a verb. Love—the feeling—is a fruit of love, the verb. So love her. Serve her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?” In the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb. Reactive people make it a feeling. They’re driven by feelings. ^ref-33865

We can make a promise—and keep it. Or we can set a goal—and work to achieve it. As we make and keep commitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integrity that gives us the awareness of self-control and the courage and strength to accept more of the responsibility for our own lives. ^ref-48575

The first is from your family, immediate and also extended—children, brothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all over the country to attend. The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense of what you were as a person. The third speaker is from your work or profession. And the fourth is from your church or some community organization where you’ve been involved in service. ^ref-34610

Thoughts on highlight:

1. Dependable amd important, often leading by example.
2. Reliable, supportive and inspiring.
3. Diligent, honest, hardworking and a great leader.

We may be very busy, we may be very efficient, but we will also be truly effective only when we begin with the end in mind. ^ref-37615

In our personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstances outside our Circle of Influence to shape much of our lives by default. ^ref-46778

Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual has phrased it, “like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic.” No management success can compensate for failure in leadership. ^ref-56795

When responsibilities increase and stresses come in the marriage, we tend to revert to the scripts we were given as we were growing up. But so does our spouse. And those scripts are usually different. Different ways of handling financial, child discipline, or in-law issues come to the surface. When these deep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered relationship reveals all its vulnerability. ^ref-15851

Thoughts on highlight:

The risk to lifestyles where attention is isolated to just the spousal relationship


---
Page: 105

People who are family-centered get their sense of security or personal worth from the family tradition and culture or the family reputation. Thus, they become vulnerable to any changes in that tradition or culture and to any influences that would affect that reputation. ^ref-40702

“Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.” ^ref-33660

Page: 128

In the words of Abraham Maslow, “He that is good with a hammer tends to think everything is a nail.” ^ref-7736

Expand your mind. Visualize in rich detail. Involve as many emotions and feelings as possible. Involve as many of the senses as you can. ^ref-20177

If you visualize the wrong thing, you’ll produce the wrong thing. ^ref-7405

One of the main things his research showed was that almost all of the world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel it; they experience it before they actually do it. They begin with the end in mind. ^ref-18052

Organize and execute around priorities. ^ref-1045

THE TIME MANAGEMENT MATRIX ^ref-35340

Page: 153

To paraphrase Peter Drucker, effective people are not problem-minded; they’re opportunity-minded. They feed opportunities and starve problems. They think preventively. They have genuine Quadrant I crises and emergencies that require their immediate attention, but the number is comparatively small. ^ref-12606

Page: 167

Again, you simply can’t think efficiency with people. You think effectiveness with people and efficiency with things. ^ref-44668

Page: 170

Management is essentially moving the fulcrum over, and the key to effective management is delegation. ^ref-5590

Page: 183

We can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, leadership or management in our personal lives. We feel vaguely uneasy and uncomfortable and occasionally take steps to ease the pain, at least for a time. Because the pain is chronic, we get used to it, we learn to live with it. ^ref-45324
