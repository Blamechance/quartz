Basically: 
"**Depression: the documentary.** "

Their iterative workflow doesn't look that different to the typical development PR type workflow, with the director acting as the gatekeeper/reviewer, ensuring commits meet a certain standard and vision before allowing it through. 

Each iteration with Yoshinari is incredibly intimate, with each animator's work and thus ability, being scrutinised over the most minute details. The video provides glimpses at how emotions often spill over for those frustrated (such as at [59:30](https://youtu.be/7LgHOUTZ8Gc?si=Tmfk2jLD6OsWnFGW&t=3571) ) at themselves.

The process seen through the lens here though strongly emphasises the honest, upfront ownership over each person's output -- but really, that attitude and culture could be applied to any kind of craft. 

But, super inspiring to see such a dense hub of ambition and people dedicated solely to their craft. The interactions between the inexperienced and the veteran craftsman was also super cool to see (Yoshinari is basically a 10x dev).
