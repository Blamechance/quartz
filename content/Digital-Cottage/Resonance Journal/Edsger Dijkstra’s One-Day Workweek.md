Dijkstra only went into university once a week to discuss ideas, and yet was able to produce high volume of academic reports during the tenure. 

Maybe this is something only possible for those who are truly passionate and at the top of their field?

The difference seems to me, to be the difference between learning and ruminating/creation. 


**Takeaway:** 
Once comfortable enough with a stack of technologies, draw a line with discipline to not obsess over new additions, and just focus on **creation**.
