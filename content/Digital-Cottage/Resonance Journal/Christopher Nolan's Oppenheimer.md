- Super inspiring to be reminded of the incredibly impressive figures that spurred the [scientific revolution of the 20th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_century_in_science). 
	- Reminded me of my fascination as a younger child, with inventors and their creations made through the magic of science and logic. 
- Very interesting to draw parallels in community and purpose of the science scene of then, and the start-up/tech culture of today. 
- Subtle parallels exist, such as:
	- Individuals creating for the sake of progress and personal ego, with little priority on the ethics and politics surrounding it -- a commonly voiced concern with AGI development. 
- Oppenheimer seemed an incredibly intelligent and accomplished visionary, who occupied a leadership/orchestrative enabled by his multi-faceted [expertise and interests](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/4841924-isidore-i-rabi-a-close-friend-and-admirer-of-oppenheimer) -- somewhat similar to individuals like Steve Jobs.
