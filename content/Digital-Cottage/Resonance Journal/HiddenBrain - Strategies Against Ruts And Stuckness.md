# Podcast Notes: 
**The goal gradient:**
- As the goal becomes into sight, the experience in working towards something begins to exhibit a "downhill" motivational effect. 
- Inversely, we become much slower towards the middle of the process -- where the start and finish lines are equally disconnected. 
The lack of "landmarks" such as a ship within the sea, where there are no indicators or sense of progress. This will lead to a sense of progress. 
- Create sub-goals along a map, as this allows you to track progress tangibly. 
- Shrink goals as small as possible, as the smaller the units of work, the better you can track it.
- This way, each small task unit can simulate the "step-after-step" or "rep-after-rep" mentalities echoed by runners and Arnold Schwarzenegger respectively.

**Motion builds momentum -- utilise small victories, even if simple, to lubricate the motion towards the larger ones:**
- Author example: 
	Setting a timer for 60 seconds, to push self to write any amount of words, towards a longer writing goal. 
*My own anecdotes:*
- Solving easy coding problems, to lubricate the logic muscles and reduce friction to coding sessions/tackling harder problems or projects.
- Short gym workouts, to ease into larger ones. 
- Short "just get out the house" cardio sessions, that turn themselves into twice a week longer ones. 

**The paralysis of perfectionism:**
- Perfectionism signals flaws and failure to your own feedback systems -- this kills motivation, and stifles productivity. 
- The quality of user-generated output, is potentially only accessible by first "pouring out the bad stuff", and getting past the low quality generation of content. 
- Are my ambitious goal setting methods, with tight personal deadlines (shoot for the moon and reach the stars method) not conducive to overall productivity due to this effect? 

**The lack of dialogue over shared stuckness:**
- Social media is particularly terrible for this - as there are no highlighting of stuckness and slowness, despite it being a natural phenomena to progress. 
- This "pluralistic ignorance" is amplified as only successes are shared, from a network of people, in a way that it is consistently visible, implying a normalcy that is false. 
- Breakdown the pluralistic ignorance, by breaking the silos between people, and opening dialogue between the frictions, stuckpoints and obstacles!

**A long journey is rarely a linear path:**
- Success is not often through a single golden ticket route -- by this strict binary definition, success would seldom happen. 
	- Define success through a **system**, bring the locus of control internal -- and measure success by elements in which you have control.
	- e.g Time spent coding, problems solved, projects created etc. 

**Quantity is a unavoidable precursor to quality**:
- You NEED the misses, to have successes in aggregate. 
- Try multiple approaches, and try different things, in order to find the right path. 

**Steady practice evolving into a sense of no progression - plateaus**:
- Habituation could lead to this effect -- you gain expertise to the routine and system, as opposed to reacting to the target challenges. 
- Comfort, provided from doing the same thing over and over again, turns into complacency that leads to stagnation. 

**Find what really matters -- every topic contains an overwhelming volume of information**
- Learn to strip away and set artificial constraints on input data, as to develop effective comprehension and productivity. 

**Negative Stereotype Effect:**
- Awareness that you belong to a group that have a stereotype of being poor within that community, it CREATES the effect of increased metal stuckness and low morale. 
	- Do not let the stereotype effect define your potential -- recognise it, maybe, as a challenge, but not a defining characteristic. 

**Action above all**
- Being stuck is about being in one place, but wanting to be somewhere else. 
- Ultimately, the thing you have to do the most, is **ACT** and move towards that direction. 
- In the act of doing, you show to yourself inserts change and potential -- whereas sitting still and thinking, simply does nothing but perpetuates the current situation. 

**Hitting the button to shuffle the letters**
- Sometimes, you just need a different perspective to things. 

**Having, and achieving any goal, even if unrelated to the main muse, provides movement that can aid unstucking**:
- It allows your mind to realise, you are NOT stuck. 
# Takeways:
## Strategies against stuckness: 

**Be aware of the "U-shape" trap to feelings of progress.**
- The middle of the journey will be the most difficult, and also where the majority of these strategies can be applied. 

**Break up and shrink goals and tasks to be as granular as possible. This provides an effective way to track and sense progress.** 
- Create a map towards goals, comprised of these granular tasks as it's units. This allows a visualisation of total progress, expressed in granular, seemingly unimportant completions. 

**Never aim for perfection.** 
- Perfectionism is a detriment to all systems. It provides only compounding negative feedback, as anything that is not perfect, is a failure. 
- Utilise small victories, no matter how novel or even unrelated, to build movement. 
- Be aware of the requirement to **leverage quantity, to find quality** (pouring the bad out first). 
- Action, no matter how unsure the direction, is often better than to sit and wondering will maintain cirucmstances -- It provides the circumstance exposure to **potential**. 

**Fight against habituation, which ultimately, leads to stagnation.**
