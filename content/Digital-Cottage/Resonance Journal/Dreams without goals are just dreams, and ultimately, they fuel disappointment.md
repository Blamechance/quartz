>Dreams without goals are just dreams, and ultimately, they fuel disappointment. On the road to achieving your dreams, you must apply discipline, but more importantly **consistency**.  Because without commitment, you'll never start. But without consistency, you'll never finish. " 
>
>~ Pastor A. R. Bernard / Denzel Washington.

I find this quote very simple and elegant, in it's ability to represent the fundamentals to accomplishing goals.
