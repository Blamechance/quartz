- Steve Jobs and John allowed design teams to butt heads and have more of a leading role in product design, which required engineering teams to accommodate and compromise, for design goals. 
- Apple's design is rooted in Bauhaus design concepts. 
- This design first thinking lead to the intention of humanising the technology -- apple's use of transparent iMac's resonated through the industry, and was then followed in suit by many other companies (gameboys etc). 
- Steve called Jony his "spiritual partner at Apple" -- his opinion was well respected as one of, if not it's leading second voice at the company. 
- Jony conceptualised the iPhone model, with an "infinity pool type design to the display" privately to Steve as to avoid having the idea stifled by engineering. 
- He was even knighted!
