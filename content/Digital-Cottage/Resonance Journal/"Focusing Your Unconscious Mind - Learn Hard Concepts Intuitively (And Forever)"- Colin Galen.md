## TL;DR: 
Guide the learning process by trying to “invent” the concepts you are learning, with genuine interest.

This increases the mental investment, and interaction with the ideas. It also makes the solution/concept more engaging when learned. 

- Can also look at problems, and try and reverse-engineer the applied concept — this has the same effect.
- Focus on learning concepts as a big picture of the solution — abstraction is key, as details can be figured out later.

	- This includes making insights and mental associations to existing ideas — research further if required to facilitate this.

### The process:

1. Start with how it slots in the big picture. 
2. Pick a detail to learn, and understand it both by itself, and within the big picture context. 
    - Part of slotting the new concept into the “big picture” is enabling insights and associations with existing ideas that make sense.
3. In both instances, invest genuine interest and interaction while also trying to invest parts of the solution as you go.
