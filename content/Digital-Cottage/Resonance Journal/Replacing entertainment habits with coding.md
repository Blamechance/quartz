### Takeaways: 
1. Connect with the satisfaction that comes from coding, as the same satisfaction provided with gaming. 
2. The desire and grind to get good, it's difficulty curves and satisfaction is fundamentally **the same**. 
3. Have coding sessions **without purpose**: 
	- Have a guilt-free session without expectations. 
	- Do it without the thoughts of why it's important and what it leads to -- just code and have fun. 
	- This is ultimately productive, as it's undeniably contributing to hours of mastery. 
4. Similarly, cultivate the same satisfaction from playing quick games, with that of solving quick exercises. 
5. [Coding is NOT study!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HggHXFnPOY4) It's an art, and should be treated as a creative hobby. 
	- Program what you love, until you love coding!


### Other key parallels: 
- Having a seat at the table among those who are admirably impressive, and masters of their craft. 
- The "git gud" grind, and the satisfaction from being someone who can answer questions and show other people how to get better. 
- The nugget of dopamine that comes from "winning" -- solving a problem and making progress. 
- Reaching achievements such as rank/elo -> certificates, projects, levelling up jobs or promotions.
- Becoming really good at something, and seeing personal stature rise within the community as you become better, more experienced -- **being able to productively butthead with other brilliant peers.**  
- Coding has it's own meta, arguments and community similar to games.
