Welcome to my digital cottage space!

My vision is for it to be a place to:
- Showcase my learning journey
- Share my thoughts, experiences and other mental snippets
- Share notes (technical and non) stored in my obsidian vault. 
- Store just enough of my personality so I can one day live eternally as an AI 

Feel free to poke around - it's a work in progress!
